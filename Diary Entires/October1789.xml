He returned to America in 1780, served in the Continental Congress 1782–83, and was United States senator from South Carolina 1789–95. A staunch Federalist, his connection with GW dated from 1780 when he had visited the commander-in-chief at headquarters (see GW to Samuel Huntington, 6 Sept. 1780, DNA:PCC, Item 152).</note></p>

Staats Long Morris had remained loyal to the crown during the Revolution and was living in England when, in 1787, his half brother Gouverneur Morris purchased from him his portion of the estate including the manor house, Morrisania (MINTZ, 13–16, 173–75).</note></p>

            <p>The Road for the greater part, indeed the whole way, was very rough and Stoney, but the Land strong, well covered with grass and a luxurient Crop of Indian Corn intermixed with Pompions [pumpkins] (Which were yet ungathered) in the fields. We met four droves of Beef Cattle for the <location><region>New York</region></location> Market (about 30 in a drove) some of which were very fine—also a flock of Sheep for the same place. We scarcely passed a farm house that did not abd. in Geese. Their Cattle seemed to be of a good quality and their hogs large but rather long legged. No dwelling Ho. is seen without a Stone or Brick Chimney and rarely any without a shingled roof—generally the Sides are of Shingles also. The distance of this days travel was 31 Miles in which we passed through (after leaving the Bridge) East Chester New Rochel &amp; Marmeroneck; but as these places (though they have houses of worship in them) are not regularly laid out, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the intermediate farms which are very close together and seperated, as one Inclosure from another also is, by fences of Stone which are indeed easily made, as the Country is immensely Stony. Upon enquiry we find their Crops of Wheat &amp; Rye have been abundant [462] —though of the first they had sown rather sparingly on Acct. of the destruction which had of late years been made of that grain by what is called the Hessian fly.</p>

In this Town are an Episcopal Church and a Meeting house. At <location><settlement>Norwalk</settlement></location> which is ten miles further we made a halt to feed our Horses. To the lower end of this town Sea Vessels come and at the other end are Mills, Stores, and an <orgName type="#religious">Episcopal and Presbiterian Church</orgName>. From hence to <location><settlement>Fairfield</settlement></location> where we dined and lodged, is 12 Miles; and part of it very rough Road, but not equal to that thro’ horse Neck. The superb Landscape, however, which is to be seen from the meeting house of the latter is a rich regalia. We found all the Farmers busily employed in gathering, grinding, and expressing the Juice of their Apples; the Crop of which they say is rather above Mediocrity. The Average Crop of Wheat they add, is about 15 bushels to the Acre from their fallow land—often 20 &amp; from that to 25. The Destructive evidences of <orgName type="#Britain">British</orgName> cruelty are yet visible both in <location><settlement>Norwalk</settlement></location> &amp; <location><settlement>Fairfield</settlement></location>; as there are the Chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet.<note>[43]</note> The principal export from <location><settlement>Norwalk</settlement></location> &amp; <location><settlement>Fairfield</settlement></location> is Horses and Cattle—Salted Beef &amp; Porke, Lumber &amp; Indian Corn, to the West Indies—and in a small degree Wheat &amp; Flour.</p>
           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 41. In 1788 Jacques (Jean) Pierre Brissot de Warville had traveled through the same area of western Greenwich on his way to New York. “The agreeable part of our journey ended at Fairfield,” Brissot noted. “For thirty-three miles from this town to Rye we had to fight our way over rocks and precipices. I did not know which to admire more, the driver’s daring or his skill. I cannot conceive how he succeeded twenty times in preventing the carriage from being shattered, or how his horses could check the coach when going down the veritable stairways of rocks. The word ‘stairways’ is no exaggeration. One of these, known as Horseneck, is nothing but a steep slope of boulders; if the [463] horses slipped, the coach would tumble 200 or 300 feet down into the valley below” (BRISSOT, 121).</note></p>

The Road between these two places is not on the whole bad (for this Country)—in some places very gd. especially through Et. <location><settlement>Fairfield</settlement></location> wch. is in a plain, and free from Stone. There are two decent looking Churches in this place—though small—viz.—an <orgName type="#religious">Episcopal</orgName> and <orgName type="#religious">Presbeterian</orgName>, or <orgName type="#religious">Congregationalist</orgName> (as they call themselves). At <location><settlement>Stratford</settlement></location> there is the same. At this place I was received with an effort of <orgName type="#USmilitary">Military</orgName> parade; and was attended to the Ferry which is near a mile from the Center of the Town, by sevl. Gentlemen on horse back. <persName>Doctr. Johnson</persName> of the <orgName type="#political">Senate</orgName> visited me here, being with <persName>Mrs. Johnson </persName>in this Town (where he formerly resided).<note>[44]</note> The Ferry is near half a Mile; and sometimes much incommoded by Winds and cross tides. The Navigation for Vessels of about 75 [464] Tonns extends up to Darby, ten Miles higher, where it is said there is a pretty brisk trade. At <location><settlement>Stratford</settlement></location> they are establishing a Manufactury of Duck, and have lately turned out about 400 bolts.<note>[45]</note> From the Ferry it is abt. 3 Miles to <location><settlement>Milford</settlement></location>, which is situated in more uneven and Stoney grd. than the 3 last Villages through wch. we passed. In this place there is but one Church, or in other words but one steeple—but there are Grist &amp; saw Mills and a handsome Cascade over the Tumbling dam; but one of the prettiest things of this kind is at Stamford occasioned also by damming the water for their Mills; it is near 100 yds. in width, and the water now being of a proper height, and the Rays of the Sun striking upon it as we passed, had a pretty effect upon the foaming Water as it fell. From <location><settlement>Millford</settlement></location> we took the lower road through West haven, part of which was good and part rough, and arrived at <location><settlement>New haven</settlement></location> before two Oclock; We had time to Walk through several parts of the City before Dinner. By taking the lower Road, we missed a Committee of the assembly, who had been appointed to wait upon, and escort me into town—to prepare an Address and to conduct me when I should leave the City as far as they should judge proper.<note>[46]</note> The address was presented at 7 Oclock and at Nine I received another address from the Congregational Clergy of the place.<note>[47]</note> Between the rect. of the two Addresses I received the Compliment of a Visit from the <persName>Govr.

Styles</persName>.<note>[51]</note> The Harbour of this place is not good for large Vessels—abt. 16 belongs to it. The Linnen Manufacture does not appear to be of so much importance as I had been led to believe—In a word I could hear but little of it.<note>[52]</note> The Exports from this City are much the same as from <location><settlement>Fairfield</settlement></location> &amp;ampca; and flax seed (chiefly to <location><region>New York</region></location>). The Road from Kings bridge to this place runs as near the Sound as the Bays and Inlets will allow, but from hence to <location><settlement>Hartford</settlement></location> it leaves the Sound and runs more to the Northward.</p>

In coming to it we passed thro East haven about mid way; after riding along the river of that name 6 Miles on which are extensive Marshes Now loaded with hay stacks—the ride is very pleasant, but the Road is Sandy which it continues to be within a Mile of the Tavern (Carringtons which is but an ordinary house)<note>[57]</note> at <location><settlement>Wallingford</settlement></location>. This and about five Miles of the Road beyond—that is West of <location><settlement>New haven</settlement></location>—is all the Sand we have met with on the journey. These Sandy Lands afford but ordinary Crops of Corn—nor has the Crops of this grain East of Stratford River appeared so heavy as on the West side of it. The Lands (Stone being less) are in part enclosed with Posts &amp; Rails. At this place (Wallingford) we see the white Mulberry growing, raised from the Seed to feed the Silk worm. We also saw samples of lustring (exceeding good) which had been manufactured from the Cocoon raised in this Town, and silk thread very fine. This, except the weaving, is the work of private families without interference with other business, and is likely to turn out a benificial amusement. In the Township of Mansfield they are further advanced in this business. Walling ford has a Church &amp; two meeting houses in it, which stands upon high and pleasant grd. About 10 Oclock we left this place and at the distance of 8 Miles passed through <location><settlement>Durham</settlement></location>. At one we arrived at <location><settlement>Middletown</settlement></location> on Connecticut River being met two or three Miles from it by the respectable Citizens of the place, and escorted in by them. While dinner was getting ready I took a walk round the Town, from the heights of which the prospect is beautiful. Belonging to this place I was informed (by a <persName>Genl. Sage</persName>) <note>[58]</note> that there was about 20 Sea Vessels and to Weathersfield higher up 22 and to <location><settlement>Hartford</settlement></location> the like number. Other places on the River have their proportion, the whole amounting to about 10,000 Tonns. The Country hereabouts is beautiful and the Lands good. An average Crop of wheat from an Acre of fallowed Land is estimated at 15 bushels; sometimes [468] they get as high as 25 and 30 bushls. to the Acre from their best lands—Indian Corn from 20 to 40 bushls. pr. Acre. Their exports are the same as from other places; together with Pot ash. Having dined, we set out with the same Escort (who conducted us into town) about 3 Oclock for <location><settlement>Hartford</settlement></location>, and passing through a Parish of <location><settlement>Middletown</settlement></location> &amp; Weathersfield, we arrived at <location><settlement>Harfd</settlement></location>. about Sun down.

He had served in the Connecticut militia during the Revolution. Under the Confederation, Sage had held the post of naval officer for the port of Middletown, Conn., and in the summer of 1789 had written GW asking that he be retained in the revenue service (31 July, 8 Aug. 1789, DLC:GW). On 18 Aug. 1789 GW replied, expressing his regret that the post for Middletown had already been filled (DLC:GW). According to local tradition, Sage was confined to his bed at the time of GW’s visit (CROFUT, 2:469). Since Sage’s pretensions were supported by such prominent citizens of Connecticut as Gov. Samuel Huntington (Huntington to GW, 19 Dec. 1789, DLC:GW), it is likely that GW’s call was intended to soften his refusal. In Feb. 1790 the incumbent of the Middletown post resigned and Sage received the appointment (EXECUTIVE JOURNAL, 1:38, 40).</note></p>

Wadsworth’s major concern in 1789 was the Hartford Woolen Manufactory, founded in 1788, of which he was the largest shareholder.

The Hartford Woolen Manufactory began with a capital of £1,200 which by 1791 had been expanded to £2,800 and, although not incorporated, had received encouragement from the state of Connecticut in the form of tax exemptions and bounties. GW’s examination of the new textile manufactory increased his interest in the possibility of introducing such a system of manufacturing in his own state or at least offering inducements to Virginia farmers to increase the number of sheep. He wrote Gov. Beverley Randolph of Virginia: “By a little Legislative encouragement, the Farmers of Connecticut have, in two years past, added one hundred thousand to their former stock. In my late tour thro’ the Eastern States, I found that the Manufacturers of Woolens (for the Manufacture of Woolens is carried on there to very considerable extent and advantage) preferred the Wool raised in Virginia for its fineness, to that raised in more Northern parts of the Continent. If a greater quantity of Wool could be produced and if the hands (which are often in a manner idle) could be employ’d in the manufacturing it; a spirit of industry might be promoted, a great diminution might be made in the annual expences of individual families, and the Public would eventually be exceedingly benefitted” (GW to Randolph, 22 Nov. 1789, DLC:GW). In the spring of 1789 GW had received from the directors of the Hartford Manufactory “A Pattern of fine Cloth of our Fabrick which the Company flatter themselves Your Excellency will Receive as A Token of their support &amp; Esteem” (Daniel Hinsdale to GW, 23 Mar. 1789, and GW to Hinsdale, 8 April 1789, DLC:GW).</note></p>

The Distance from <location><settlement>Hartford</settlement></location> to <location><settlement>Springfield </settlement></location>is 28 Miles—both on Connecticut River. At the latter the River is crossed in Scows, set over with Poles and is about 80 rod wide.

The whole Road from <location><settlement>Hartford</settlement></location> to <location><settlement>Springfield</settlement></location> is level &amp; good, except being too Sandy in places &amp; the Fields enclosed with Posts &amp; Rails generally their not being much Stone. The Crops of Corn, except on the Interval Lands on the River are more indifferent (tho’ not bad) in the Eastern than we found them in the Western part of the State of <location><region>Connecticut</region></location>. There is a great equality in the People of this State—Few or no oppulent Men and no poor—great similatude in their buildings—the general fashion of which is a Chimney (always of Stone or Brick) and door in the middle, with a stair case fronting the latter, running up by the side of the latter [former]—two flush Stories with a very good shew of Sash &amp; glass Windows. The size generally is from 30 to 50 feet in length and from 20 to 30 in width exclusive of a back shed which seems to be [471] added as the family encreases. The farms by the contiguity of the Houses are small not averaging more than 100 Acres. These are worked chiefly by Oxen (which have no other feed than Hay) with a horse &amp; sometimes two before them both in Plow &amp; Cart. In their light Lands and in their sleighs they work Horses, but find them much more expensive than Oxen. <location><settlement>Springfield</settlement></location> is on the East side of Connecticut River; before you come to which a large branch of it called Agawam is crossed by a Bridge.

GW replied, agreeing somewhat reluctantly to the plans for his reception. “But could my wish prevail I should desire to visit your Metropolis without any parade, or extraordinary ceremony. From a wish to avoid giving trouble to private families, I determined, on leaving New York, to decline the honor of any invitation to quarters which I might receive while on my journey and with a view to observe this rule, I had requested a Gentleman to engage lodgings for me during my stay at Boston” (DLC:GW).</note></p>

He was appointed a major in the Continental Army in 1776 and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel by the end of the war. In 1786 Gov. James Bowdoin appointed him major general in the Middlesex militia where he served during Shays’s Rebellion.
            On 21 Oct. Brooks had sent his aide, Maj. Joseph Hall, with a letter to GW explaining plans for his reception in Boston. As a testimony of the city’s respect, Brooks proposed that “a body of about 800 men, will be under arms at Cambridge on the day of your entering into Boston. The troops will occupy the ground on which the continental army was formed for your reception in the year 1775” (DLC:GW).</note></p>

Govr. &amp; Council in the order we came from <location><settlement>Cambridge</settlement></location> (preceeded by the Town Corps very handsomely dressed) we passed through the Citizens classed in their different professions, and under their own banners, till we came to the State House; from which, across the Street, an Arch was thrown; in the front of which was this Inscription—<quote>“To the Man who unites all hearts”</quote> and on the other—<quote>“To Columbia’s favourite Son”</quote> and on one side thereof next the State House, in a pannel decorated with a trophy, composed of the arms of the United States—of the Commonwealth of <location><region>Massachusetts</region></location>—and our <orgName type="#nation">French</orgName> Allies, crowned with a wreath of Laurel was this Inscription—<quote>“Boston relieved March 17th. 1776.”</quote> This arch was handsomely ornamented, and over the Center of it a Canopy was erected 20 feet high with the American Eagle perched on the top. After passing through the Arch, and entering the State House at the So. End &amp; [as]cending to the upper floor &amp; returning to a Balcony at the No. end—three [475] cheers was given by a vast concourse of people who by this time had assembled at the Arch.

The Streets, the Doors, Windows &amp; Tops of the Houses were crouded with well dressed Ladies and Gentlemen. The procession being over I was conducted to my lodgings at a Widow Ingersolls<note>[79]</note> (which is a very decent &amp; good house) by the Lieutt. Govr. and Council—accompanied by the Vice-President where they took leave of me. Having engaged yesterday to take an informal dinner with the Govr. to day (but under a full persuation that he would have waited upon me so soon as I should have arrived) I excused myself upon his not doing it, and informing me thro his Secretary that he was too much indisposed to do it, being resolved to receive the visit.<note>[80]</note> Dined at my Lodgings, where the Vice-President favoured me with his Company. <note>[81]</note></p>

            <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 78. The Massachusetts Magazine, Oct. 1789, noted that “At one o’clock, the President’s approach was announced by federal discharges from . . . artillery at Roxbury—from the Dorchester artillery posted on the celebrated heights of that town—from . . . artillery at the entrance of the town—and from Castle William; by a royal salute from the Ships of his most Christian Majesty’s squadron, and by the ringing of all the bells.” The Pennsylvania Packet, 18 Nov. 1789, observed that the “President’s dress, on his arrival . . . was the American uniform, with two rich apaulets. His other dress is black velvet.”</note></p>
           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 79. The “Ode to Columbia’s Favorite Son: Great Washington, the Hero’s Come . . .” is printed in Pennsylvania Packet, 4 Nov. 1789. It was sung by the Independent Musical Society. To some observers GW appeared uncomfortable: “A gentleman who was present at his arrival in Boston observed that when he came out of the State House to hear the Ode that was sung on the occasion, every muscle of his face appeared agitated, and he was frequently observed to pass . . . his handkerchief across his eyes” (Hist. Collections of the Essex Institute, 67 [1931], 299–300).</note></p>

In the house are three parlours in the lower floor—three bed chambers on the second—and sufficient on the third to accomodate servants.

           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 81. After GW had refused Hancock’s offer of lodging while the president was in Boston (see entry for 22 Oct. 1789), the governor had replied, 23 Oct., extending an invitation to GW and “the Gentlemen of your suit” to dine with him “en famille, at any hour that the circumstances of the day will admit” (DLC:GW). On the same day GW replied from Weston accepting the invitation (DNA: RG 59, Misc. Letters). The president had, however, assumed that the governor would make the first call. When it became apparent that Hancock’s illness, real or feigned, would not be an acceptable excuse to the president, he sent GW a note stating that “the Governor will do himself the honor of paying his respects in half an hour. This would have been done much sooner had his health in any degree permitted. He now hazards every thing as it respects his health for the desirable purpose” (26 Oct. 1789, DLC:GW). Hancock’s illness was reported to be gout. For public furor over the incident, see Boston Gaz., 26 Oct., 2 Nov. 1789, and Mass. Centinel, 28 Oct. 1789.</note></p>

The Lt. Govr. &amp; two of the Council to wit Heath &amp; Russel<note>[84]</note>were sent here last Night to express the Govrs.

Rev. Peter Thacher (1752–1802), a native of Milton, Mass., was a 1769 Harvard graduate. Ordained before the Revolution, he served in several military capacities in 1775 and wrote an account of the Battle of Bunker Hill. In 1785 he became minister of the Brattle Street Congregational Church, one of New England’s most distinguished pulpits, and remained there until his death (SIBLEY, 17:237–47).</note></p>

            <p><note resp="editorsWash">85. GW was apparently one of the early victims of an epidemic of colds and influenza that followed his visit to Boston. Because it afflicted many of the spectators who stood in the bitterly cold wind during the festivities, the ailment was thereafter referred to as the “Washington influenza.” In fact, it was part of a widespread epidemic of respiratory ailments which had already swept through the central and southern states and was now spreading into New England (Pa.

Cobb was one of GW’s aides-de-camp 1781–83 and was brevetted brigadier general in Sept. 1783. After the war he held a number of judicial posts in Massachusetts, was appointed major general in the state militia in 1786, and in 1789 was speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

In spite of GW’s refusal, Christian Güllager (1759–1826), a Danish artist living in Boston, apparently made some preliminary sketches in Boston which GW later approved. On 3 Nov., while in Portsmouth, N.H., he gave the artist a sitting for the Portsmouth Bust Portrait which Güllager probably completed [479] from memory and which was eventually presented to the Massachusetts Historical Society (EISEN, 2:427–28).

They have 28 looms at work &amp; 14 Girls spinning with Both hands (the flax being fastened to their waste). Children (girls) turn the wheels for them, and with this assistance each spinner can turn out 14 lbs. of thread pr. day when they stick to it, but as they are pd. by the piece, or work they do, there is no other restraint upon them but to come at 8 Oclock in the Morning and return at 6 in the evening. They are the daughters of decayed families, and are girls of Character—none others are admitted. The number of hands now employed in the different parts of the work is [      ] but the Managers expect to encrease them to [      ]. This is a work of public utility &amp; private advantage.<note>[91]</note> From hence I went to the Card Manufactury where I was informed about 900 hands of one kind and for one purpose or another.

            <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 91. Boston Sailcloth Manufactory had been established in 1788 by a group of Boston merchants and businessmen under the leadership of Samuel Breck and Thomas Alkers, in hope of profiting from a bounty offered by the Massachusetts legislature in Mar. 1788 on the production of duck and sailcloth. The factory was erected in the area of what was then Nassau Street and Frog Lane (Boylston Street), and production was underway by early 1789. By 1792 “there were four hundred employees, and the weekly product was not less than fifty pieces of duck” (BAGNALL, 116). One observer noted that GW “made him self merry on this Occasion, telling the overseer he believed he collected the prettiest girls in Boston” (WEBB [2], 3:142–44).</note></p>
           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 92. Presumably this was the cotton and wool card factory of Giles Richard and Co., on Hanover Square, supposedly the largest such establishment in Massachusetts. In 1791 Nathaniel Gorham, supervisor of the revenue for Massachusetts, reported that the company’s improvements in machinery for carding had developed to such an extent that “models of two of their principal machines, were lately purchased by an English Gentleman for nearly one hundred pounds sterling. . . . At present the works are in such perfection, that Eight men can turn out Fifty dozen [cards] per day” (Gorham to Hamilton, 13 Oct. 1791, HAMILTON [2], 9:375).</note></p>

The Chief employmt. of the People of Marblehead (Males) is fishing—about 110 Vessels and 800 Men and boys are engaged in this business. Their chief export is fish. About 5000 Souls are said to be in this place which has the appearance of antiquity. The Houses are old—the streets dirty—and the common people not very clean. Before we entered the Town we were met, &amp; attended by a Comee. till we were handed over to the Select Men who conducted us saluted by artily. in to the Town—to the House of a <persName>Mrs. Lee</persName> where there was a cold Collation prepared <note>[99]</note>—after partaking of which we visited the Harbour—their fish brakes for curing fish—&amp;ampca; and then proceeded (first receiving an Address from the Inhabitants) to <location><settlement>Salem</settlement></location>.

           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 96. Joseph Willard (1738–1804), a member of a prominent New England family and an ardent Federalist, was president of Harvard from 1781 to 1804. Through his extensive writings and correspondence he became well known as a scientist and mathematician and led the college out of the financial and academic disorganization caused by the Revolution. GW was received at Harvard in the “Philosophy-room of the University” (Pa. Packet, 13 Nov. 1789).</note></p>
            <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 97. The orrery at Harvard was the work of Joseph Pope, Boston watchmaker, who had worked on it from 1776 to 1787. “It was an elaborate structure based on the design of the grand orreries produced by the great English makers of the period, measuring 6½ feet in diameter and 6½ feet in height. It was covered with a glass dome with the signs of the zodiac painted on the glass side panels, and was supported on a hexagonal frame of mahogany in the Chippendale style. Twelve figures adorned its corners; these were said to have been carved in wood by Simeon Skillin and cast in bronze by Paul Revere.” The instrument had been purchased for Harvard through a lottery sponsored by the Massachusetts legislature in Mar. 1789 (BEDINI, 384–85).</note></p>
           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 98. Jonathan Titcomb of Newburyport, Mass., had been in command of a Massachusetts regiment in 1775 and charged with securing supplies for the army during GW’s tour of duty at Cambridge. By the end of the war he was a major general in the state forces. In June 1789 he solicited the post of naval officer for Newburyport, and GW appointed him in August (Titcomb to GW, 19 June 1789, DLC:GW; EXECUTIVE JOURNAL, 1:9, 12). Two members of the Titcomb family of Newburyport—Michael and Zebulon—had been members of the Commander-in-Chief’s Guard during the Revolution (GODFREY, 259–60).</note></p>
           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 99. Mrs. Lee was Martha Swett Lee (d. 1791), daughter of Joseph and Hannah Swett of Marblehead and wife of Col. Jeremiah Lee, a prominent Marblehead shipowner. The Lee house, on Washington Street, was an elegant mansion constructed in 1768, and Mrs. Lee was a noted hostess. According to local tradition, silhouettes of eagles were placed in the windows of the house during GW’s visit so they would show against the lighted candles (LORD, 234–36).</note></p>
            <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 100.These military units included the Salem town regiment, “joined by a Regiment from Lynn, with the Horse from Ipswich, the Independant Company, &amp; the Artillery. The Ipswich Horse were in blue with hats, the Independants in red, &amp; the Artillery in black uniforms. The Militia were partly in Rifle frocks” (Bentley, Diary, 1:130).</note></p>
            <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 101. To one observer GW’s progress to the courthouse seemed less than triumphant: “His appearance as he passed thro’ Court Street in Salem was far from gay, or making anyone else so. He looked oppressed by the attention that was paid him, and as he cast his eye around, I thought it seemed to sink at the notice he attracted. When he had got to the Court House, and had patiently listened to the ditty they sung at him, and heard the shouts of the multitude, he bowed very low, and as if he could bear no more turned hastily around and went into the house” (Hist. Collections of the Essex Institute, 67 [1931], 299–300).</note></p>
            <p> <note resp="editorsWash"> 102. While in Salem, GW lodged at the imposing Ward House on Court (now [485]Washington) Street, constructed between 1781 and 1785 by Samuel McIntire, and presently owned by Joshua Ward. For GW’s stay in Salem, see Bentley, Diary, 130–31; Gaz. of the U.S., 14 Nov. 1789; rantoul, 68:1–19).</note></p>
           <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 103. The inhabitants of Salem had sent GW an invitation to attend the entertainment, 23 Oct. 1789 (DLC:GW).</note></p>
            <p><date>Friday 30th.</date> A Little after 8 Oclock I set out for <location><settlement>Newbury-Port</settlement></location> and in less than 2 Miles crossed the Bridge between <location><settlement>Salem</settlement></location> and <location><settlement>Beverly</settlement></location>, which makes a handsome appearance, and is upon the same plan of those over Charles &amp; Mistick Rivers; excepting that it has not foot ways as that of the former has. The length of this bridge is 1530 feet and was built for about £4500 lawful money—a price inconceivably low in my estimation, as there is 18 feet water in the deepest parts of the River over which it is erected. This Bridge is longer than that at Charles town, but shorter by [      ] feet than the other over Mistick. All of them have draw bridges by which Vessels pass. After passing <location><settlement>Beverley</settlement></location> 2 Miles we come to the Cotton Manufactury which seems to be carrying on with Spirit by the <persName>Mr. Cabbots</persName> (principally).<note>[104]</note> In this Manufactury they have the New Invented Carding and Spinning Machines—one of the first supplies the work; and four of the latter; one of which spins 84 threads at a time by one person. The Cotton is [486] prepared for these Machines by being first (lightly) drawn to a thrd. on the common wheel. There is also another Machine for doubling and twisting the threads for particular cloths. This also does many at a time. For winding the Cotton from the spindles, &amp; preparing it for the Warp, there is a Reel which expedites the work greatly. A number of Looms (15 or 16) were at work with Spring shuttles which do more than dble. work. In short the whole seemed perfect, and the Cotton stuffs wch. they turn out excellent of their kind. Warp &amp; filling both are now of Cotton. From this place with escorts of Horse I passed on to <location><settlement>Ipswich</settlement></location> about 10 Miles—at the entrance of which I was met and welcomed by the Select Men and received by a Regemt. of <orgName type="#USmilitary">Militia</orgName>. At this place I was met by <persName>Mr. Dalton</persName> and some other Gentlemen from <location><settlement>Newbury</settlement></location>-port—partook of a Cold Collation, &amp; proceeded on to the last-mentioned place where I was received with much respect &amp; parade, about 4 Oclock. In the evening there were Rockets &amp; some other fire-works and every other demonstration to welcome me to the Town. This place is pleasantly situated on Merimack River, and appears to have carried on (here &amp; about) the Ship-building business to a grt. extent. The number of Souls is estimated at 5,000.<note>[105]</note></p>
            <p><note resp="editorsWash"> 104. The Beverly Cotton Manufactory was established in 1787–88 with John Cabot and Joshua Fisher as managers and George and Andrew Cabot as leading stockholders. In its early years the factory received considerable encouragement from the Massachusetts legislature—a grant of land in 1789 and a state lottery in 1791. It was incorporated 3 Feb. 1789 (BAGNALL, 93–94).</note></p>

According to local tradition, GW left his carriage just outside of town and, mounting his horse, proceeded to South (Bromfield) and High streets where, accompanied by considerable fanfare, an ode dedicated to the president was sung. The party then proceeded to Tracy House, originally owned by Nathaniel Tracy but now occupied by Joseph Prince, where GW was to lodge (CURRIER, 408–10).</note></p>
            <p><date>Saturday 31st</date>. Left <location><settlement>Newbury</settlement></location>-port a little after 8 Oclock (first breakfasting with <persName>Mr. Dalton</persName>) <note>[106]</note> and to avoid a wider ferry—more inconvenient boats—and a piece of heavy Sand, we crossed the River at <location><settlement>Salisbury</settlement></location> two Miles above; and near that further about—and in three Miles came to the Line wch. divides the State of <location><region>Massachusetts</region></location> from that of <location><region>New Hampshire</region></location>.<note>[107]</note> Here I took leave of<persName> Mr. Dalton</persName> and many other private Gentlemen who accompanied me—also of <persName>Genl. Titcomb</persName> who had met me on the line between <location><settlement>Middlesex</settlement></location> &amp; Essex Counties—Corps of light Horse and Many officers of <orgName type="#USmilitary">Militia</orgName>—And was recd. by the President of the State of [487] <location><region>New Hampshire</region></location>—the Vice-President; some of the Council—Messrs.

With this Cavalcade we proceeded and arrived before 3 Oclock at <location><settlement>Portsmouth</settlement></location>, where we were received with every token of respect and appearance of Cordiallity under a discharge of Artillery. The Streets—doors and windows were Crouded here, as at all the other Places—and, alighting at the Town House, odes were Sung &amp; played in honor of the President. The same happened yesterday at my entrance into New-bury-port—Being stopped at my entrance to hear it. From the Town House I went to Colonel Brewsters Ta[ver]n <note>[109]</note> the place provided for my residence and asked the President, Vice-President, the two Senators, the Marshall and <persName>Majr. Gilman</persName> <note>[110]</note> to dine with me, which they did—after which I drank Tea at <persName>Mr. Langdons</persName>.<note>[111]</note></p>
