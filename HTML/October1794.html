      <p><strong><span class="date">1st</span></strong>. Left the Trap early, and breakfasting at <strong><span class="city">Potts grove</span></strong> 11 Miles we reach <strong><span class="city">Reading</span></strong> to Dinner 19 Miles farther where we found several detachmts. of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Infantry</span></strong> &amp; Cavalry preparing for their March to <strong><span class="city">Carlisle</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="city">Pottsgrove (Pottstown)</span></strong>, on the northeast bank of the Schuylkill River, at this time contained about 90 dwellings,<strong><span class="quote"> “several . . . neat and commodious,”</span></strong> and a <strong><span class="religious">Quaker</span></strong> meetinghouse (SCOTT [2]). <strong><span class="persName">Quartermaster John Hugg Clunn</span></strong> found it <strong><span class="quote">“a fine Village, some elegant buildings and the Streets broad”</span></strong> (CLUNN, 47).
      </p> 
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">During the Revolution, GW had his headquarters at Pottsgrove 21–26 Sept. 1777.</span></strong></p>

      <p> <strong><span class="date">2d.</span></strong> An accident happening to one of my horses occasiond. my setting out, later than was
         intended. I got off in time, however, to make a halt (to bait my horses) at <strong><span class="city">Womeldorfs</span></strong> 14 miles and to view the Canal from <strong><span class="city">Myers town</span></strong> towards <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong>—and the Locks between the two places; which (four adjoining each other, in the dissent
         from the Summit ground along the Tulpihockin; built of Brick;) appeared admirably
         constructed. Reached <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong> at Night 28 miles.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="city">Womelsdorf</span></strong> (Middletown) in <strong><span class="city">Berks County</span></strong>, <strong><span class="state">Pa</span></strong>., was a <strong><span class="quote">“flourishing town . . . containing about 40 dwellings, and a German Luthern and Calvinist
               church, united”</span></strong> (SCOTT [2]). Clunn counted <strong><span class="quote">“about 50 Houses mostly built of log. The Church was built by the Lutheran’s &amp; Presbyterian’s
               for their joint use”</span></strong> (CLUNN, 48).
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="city">Myerstown</span></strong>, <strong><span class="city">Dauphin County</span></strong>, <strong><span class="state">Pa.</span></strong>, was about 77 miles from <strong><span class="city">Philadelphia</span></strong> on the north side of Tulpehocken Creek, a few miles below the canal. The canal was
         part of a construction project of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company
         and connected Quitipihilla Creek and Tulpehocken Creek (Pa. Mag., 71 [1947], 48, n.25).
         <strong><span class="persName">Quartermaster John Hugg Clunn</span></strong> of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">New Jersey militia</span></strong>, visiting the area on <strong><span class="date">8 Oct. 1794</span></strong>, found <strong><span class="city">Myerstown</span></strong> to be <strong><span class="quote">“a Village built of Log. Rode on by the Canal. The Lock is remarkably curious. An
               Irishman . . . very humbly pulld of his Hatt and asked if I knew the Custom when Gent.
               came to see the Works. I saw plainly it was 2/ out of my pocket &amp; without further
               ceremony gave it him—took another look thought it worth 4/”</span></strong> (CLUNN, 48). Another New Jersey officer noted that the <strong><span class="quote">“canal is already dug ten miles, in which are five locks, to embrace thirty feet;
               that they are executed in a masterly manner—that in the distance already done there
               is a great number of elegant arched bridges over the canal, wherever it goes across
               the road. There are now employed 600 hands at it, and every prospect of succeeding
               in this part of the bold enterprise”</span></strong> (FORD [6], 81). <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong>, in <strong><span class="city">Dauphin County</span></strong>, at this time consisted of 2 churches and about 40 houses, mostly built of log (CLUNN,
         48).

      <p> <strong><span class="date">3d</span></strong>. Breakfasted at <strong><span class="persName">Humels T</span></strong>. 14 M. and dined and lodged at <strong><span class="city">Harrisburgh</span></strong> on the Banks of the Susquehanna 23 miles from <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> At <strong><span class="city">Harrisburgh</span></strong> we found the first <strong><span class="USmilitary">Regiment</span></strong> of <strong><span class="city">New Jersey</span></strong> (about 560 strong) commd. by <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Turner</span></strong> drawn out to receive me. Passed along the line, to my Quarters—and after dinner walked
         through and round the Town which is considerable for its age (of about 8 or 9 years).
         The Susquehanna at this place abounds in the Rockfish of 12 or 15 Inches in length
         &amp; a fish which they call Salmon.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">Hummelstown, Dauphin County, ten miles east of Harrisburg, had around 90 buildings
               and a German Lutheran church (SCOTT [2]).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> Harrisburg at this time <strong><span class="quote">“is regularly laid out, and contains upwards of 300 houses; several of these are neat,
                     commodious dwellings; some of brick, and [181] others of stone; a handsome brick court
                     houses, a stone jail, &amp; a German church”</span></strong> (SCOTT [2]).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="note">turner: The 1st New Jersey Regiment was under the command of Lt. Col. Francis Davenport
               (GOULD, 181). Apparently no Colonel Turner accompanied the New Jersey troops. GW may
               have meant to write “Forman.” Lt. Col. Jonathan Forman was in command of the 3d New
               Jersey Regiment, infantry, and New Jersey militia (CLUNN, 58, n.80). Captain Gould
               notes this day that he, Colonel Forman, and another militia officer “accepted an invitation
               from the President to take a glass of wine with him (GOULD, 178).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">After his arrival in Harrisburg, a group of the town’s citizens presented GW with
               an address supporting the government. GW replied before his departure early on 4 Oct.
               (DLC:GW; Gaz. of the U.S., 16 Oct. 1794).
               4th. Forded the Susquehanna; nearly a mile wide, including the Island—at the lower
               end of wch. the road crosses it.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> On the Cumberland Side I found a detachment of the Philadelphia light horse ready
               to receive, and escort me to Carlisle 17 miles; where I arrived at about 11 Oclock.
               Two miles short of it, I met the Governors of Pennsylvania &amp; New Jersey with all the
               Cavalry that had rendezvouzed at that place drawn up—passed them—and the Infantry
               of Pennsylvania before I alighted at my quarters.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> Traveling the same route in 1783–84, Johann David Schoepf observed that the Susquehanna
               at Harrisburg was “three quarters of a mile wide, but in the summer months so shallow
               that only canoes can cross; horses and wagons ford over. In the middle are a few small
               islands, called Harris’s and also Turkey Islands” (SCHOEPF, 1:212). Captain Gould
               noted today that the troops “suffered much with the cold in crossing [the Susquehanna],
               it being a very cold morning. The President, General Washington, forded the river
               in a coach—drove it himself, &amp;c.” (GOULD, 179).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">The detachment of the Philadelphia Light Horse had left Carlisle at 3:00 A.M. and
               met GW just after he crossed the river (Dunlap’s American Daily Adv. [Philadelphia],
               17 Oct. 1794).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">At Carlisle, GW found a town “regularly laid out, consisting of several parallel streets,
               crossed by others at right angles. It contains upwards of 400 dwellings, chiefly of
               stone and brick. The public buildings are, a college, a jail, a handsome brick court-house,
               which stands in the centre of the town; and four houses for public worship” (SCOTT
               [2]). During the Revolution, Carlisle Barracks had been an ordnance depot and in 1791
               had been designated as a general rendezvous for federal troops and supplies. It is
               estimated that during the insurrection between 10,000 and 15,000 troops encamped on
               the common (TOUSEY, 164–65).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">There was “the greatest vieing between the New Jersey and Pennsylvania horse,” Captain
               Ford of the New Jersey troops noted, as to “who should be first on the ground to receive
               the President. At ten o’clock, the signal for mounting came, and away went the horse”
               (FORD [6], 85). At 12 o’clock it was announced that the president was approaching.
               “Immediately the 3 troops from Philadelphia, Gurney’s and Macpherson’s battalions,
               and the artillery paraded. The horse marched down the road about two miles, followed
               [182] by the Jersey cavalry in great numbers. We were drawn up on the right of the
               road, when our beloved Washington approached on horseback in a traveling dress, attended
               by his Secretary, &amp;c. As he passed our troop, he pulled off his hat, and in the most
               respectful manner bowed to the officers and men; and in this manner passed the line.
               . . . As soon as the President passed, his escort followed, we joined the train, and
               entered the town whose inhabitants seemed anxious to see this very great and good
               man; crowds were assembled in the streets, but their admiration was silent. In this
               manner the President passed to the front of the camp, where the troops were assembled
               in front of the tents; the line of artillery, horse and infantry, appeared in the
               most perfect order; the greatest silence was observed” (“Notes on the March from September
               30, until October 29, 1794,” Pa. Archives, 2d ser., 4:361).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">While at Carlisle, GW and his party occupied two houses belonging to Ephraim Blaine
               (1741–1804), former commissary general in the Continental Army. Blaine and his family
               not only provided lodging but also meals and hostelry service for the president and
               his staff (FREEMAN, 7:202, n.212).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">Governor of New Jersey Richard Howell (1754–1802) was born in Newark, Del., but moved
               with his family to Cumberland County, N.J. He studied law there and was admitted to
               the bar. In 1775 he joined the 2d New Jersey Regiment as a captain, served as brigade
               major with Stark’s Brigade in 1776, and again with the 2d New Jersey Regiment until
               his resignation in 1779. He became an active Federalist and was elected governor of
               New Jersey in 1793, serving until 1801. Something of a poet, Howell is credited with
               having composed the stanzas in honor of GW for the president’s reception at Assanpink
               Bridge on his way to New York in April 1789 (see also AGNEW, 221–30).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">5th</span></strong>.—Sunday. Went to the Presbiterian Meeting and heard Doctr. Davidson Preach a political
         Sermon, recommendatory of order &amp; good government; and the excellence of that of the
         <strong><span class="nation">United States</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">The First Presbyterian Church of Carlisle was on the northeast corner of the town’s
               center square. In 1785 Dr. Robert Davidson (d. 1812) had been called to the church’s
               pulpit (NEVIN, 238). Dr. Davidson was an outspoken critic of the rebellion. In a sermon
               of 28 Sept. 1794 he had railed against the “sinners” who had taken up arms against
               their government. “But if they will resist, and involve themselves in the guilt of
               rebellion, they deserve not to be pitied nor spared” (BALDWIN [3], 226).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">6th. to the 12th.</span></strong> Employed in Organizing the several detachments, which had come in from different
         Counties of this State, in a very disjointed &amp; loose manner; or rather I ought to
         have said in urging &amp; assisting <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Mifflin</span></strong> to do it; as I no otherwise took the command of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> than to press them forward, and to provide them with necessaries for their March,
         as well, &amp; as far, as our means would admit.<strong><span class="note">1</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>[183]</p>
      
      <p> To effect these purposes, I appointed General Hand Adjutant General on the <strong><span class="date">7th</span></strong>.<strong><span class="note">2</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>On the <strong><span class="date">9th</span></strong>. <strong><span class="persName">William Findley</span></strong> and <strong><span class="persName">David Redick</span></strong>—deputed by the Committee of Safety (as it is designated) which met on the <strong><span class="date">2d</span></strong>. of this month at Parkinson Ferry arrived in Camp with the Resolutions of the said
         Committee; and to give information of the State of things in the four Western Counties
         of Pennsylvania to wit—Washington Fayette Westd. &amp; Alligany in order to see if it
         would prevent the March of the Army into them.<strong><span class="note">3</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>At 10 oclock I had a meeting with these persons in presence of <strong><span class="persName">Govr. Howell </span></strong>(of <strong><span class="state">New Jersey</span></strong>) the Secretary of the Treasury, <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Hamilton</span></strong>, &amp; <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Dandridge</span></strong>: <strong><span class="persName">Govr. Mifflin</span></strong> was invited to be present, but excused himself on acct. of business.
      </p>
      
      <p> I told the Deputies that by one of the Resolutions it would appear that they were
         empowered to give information of the disposition &amp; of the existing state of matters
         in the four Counties above men[tioned]; that I was ready to hear &amp; would listen patiently,
         and with candour to what they had to say.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Findley</span></strong> began. He confined his information to such parts of the four Counties as he was best
         acquainted with; referring to<strong><span class="persName"> Mr. Reddick</span></strong> for a recital of what fell within his knowledge, in the other parts of these Counties.
      </p>
      
      <p> The substance of Mr. Findleys communications were as follows [184] —viz.—That the
         People in the parts where he was best acquainted, had seen there folly; and he believed
         were disposed to submit to the Laws; that he thought, but could not undertake to be
         responsible, for the re-establishment of the public Offices for the Collection of
         the Taxes on distilled spirits, &amp; Stills—intimating however, that it might be best
         for the present, &amp; until the peoples minds were a little more tranquilized, to hold
         the Office of Inspection at <strong><span class="city">Pitsburgh</span></strong> under the protection—or at least under the influence of the Garrison; That he thought
         the Distillers would either enter their stills or would put them down; That the Civil
         authority was beginning to recover its tone; &amp; enumerated some instances of it; That
         the ignorance, &amp; general want of information among the people far exceeded any thing
         he had any conception of; That it was not merely the excise law their opposition was
         aimed at, but to all law, &amp; Government; and to the Officers of Government; and that
         the situation in which he had been, &amp; the life he had led for sometime, was such,
         that rather than go through it again, he would prefer quitting this scene altogether.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Redicks</span></strong> information was similar to the above; except as to the three last recitals—on wch.
         I do not recollect that he expressed any sentiment further than that the situation
         of those who were not in the opposition to government whilst the frenzy was at its
         height, were obliged to sleep with their Arms by their bed Sides every night; not
         knowing but that before Morning they might have occasion to use them in defence of
         their persons, or their properties.
      </p>
      
      <p>He added, that for a long time after the riots commenced, and until lately, the distrust
         of one another was such, that even friends were affraid to communicate their sentiments
         to each other; That by whispers this was brought about; and growing bolder as they
         became more communicative they found their strength, and that there was a general
         disposition not only to acquiesce under, but to support the Laws—and he gave some
         instances also of Magistrates enforcing them.
      </p>
      
      <p> He said the People of those Counties believed that the opposition to the Excise law—or
         at least that their dereliction to it, in every other part of the <strong><span class="nation">U. States</span></strong> was similar to their own, and that no <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> could be got to March against them for the purpose of coercion; that every acct.
         until very lately, of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> marching against them was disbelieved; &amp; supposed to be the fabricated tales of governmental
         men; That now they had got alarmed; That many were disposing of their property at
         an under rate, in order to leave the Country, and added (I think) that [185] they
         wd. go to <strong><span class="city">Detroit</span></strong>. That no person of any consequence, except one, but what had availed themselves of
         the proffered amnesty; That those who were still in the opposition, and obnoxious
         to the laws, were Men of little or no property, &amp; cared but little where they resided;
         That he did not believe there was the least intention in them to oppose the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>; &amp; that there was not three rounds of ammunition for them in all the Western Country.
         He (&amp; I think <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Findley</span></strong> also) was apprehensive that the resentments of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> might be productive of treatment to some of these people that might be attended with
         disagreeable consequences; &amp; on that account seemed to deprecate the March of it:
         declaring however, that it was their wish, if the people did not give proofs of unequivocal
         submission, that it might not stop short of its object.
      </p>
      
      <p>After hearing what both had to say, I briefly told them—That it had been the earnest
         wish of governmt. to bring the people of those counties to a sense of their duty,
         by mild, &amp; lenient means; That for the purpose of representing to their sober reflection
         the fatal consequences of such conduct Commissioners had been sent amongst them that
         they might be warned, in time, of what must follow, if they persevered in their opposition
         to the laws; but that coercion wou’d not be resorted to except in the dernier resort:
         but, that the season of the year made it indispensible that preparation for it should
         keep pace with the propositions that had been made; That it was unnecessary for me
         to enumerate the transactions of those people (as they related to the proceedings
         of government) forasmuch as they knew them as well as I did; That the measure which
         they were not witness to the adoption of was not less painful than expensive—Was inconvenient,
         &amp; distressing—in every point of view; but as I considered the support of the Laws
         as an object of the first magnitude, and the greatest part of the expense had already
         been incurred, that nothing Short of the most unequivocal proofs of absolute Submission
         should retard the March of the army into the Western counties, in order to convince
         them that the government could, &amp; would enforce obedience to the laws—not suffering
         them to be insulted with impunity. Being asked again what proofs would be required,
         I answered, they knew as well as I did, what was due to justice &amp; example. They understood
         my meaning—and asked if they might have another interview. I appointed five oclock
         in the After noon for it. At this second Meeting there was little more than a repeti[ti]on
         of what had passed in the forenoon; and it being again mentioned that all the principal
         characters, except one, in the Western counties who had been in the opposition, had
         submitted [186] to the propositions—I was induced, seeing them in the Street the next
         day, to ask <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Redick</span></strong> who that one was?—telling him at the same time I required no disclosure that he did
         not feel himself entirely free to make. He requested a little time to think of it,
         and asked for another meeting—which was appointed at 5 oclock that afternoon—which
         took place accordingly when he said <strong><span class="persName">David Bradford</span></strong><strong><span class="note">4</span></strong> was the person he had alluded to in his former conversations.
      </p>
      
      <p> He requested to know if a Meeting of the people, by their deputies, would be permitted
         by the Army at any given point, on their March into that Country (with fresh evidence
         of the sincerity of their disposition to acquiesce in whatever might be required).
         I replied I saw no objection to it, provided they came unarmed; but to be cautious
         that not a gun was fired, as there could be no answering for consequences in this
         case. I assured them that every possible care should be taken to keep the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> from offering them any insult or damage and that those who always had been subordinate
         to the Laws, &amp; such as had availed themselves of the amnesty, should not be injured
         in their persons or property; and that the treatment of the rest would depend upon
         their own conduct. That the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>, unless opposed, did not mean to act as executioners, or bring offenders to a <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military Tribunal</span></strong>; but merely to aid the civil Megistrates, with whom offences would lye. Thus endd.

      <p> <strong><span class="note">1 On 6 Oct. GW wrote Secretary of State Edmund Randolph: “As I reached this place
               Saturday only, &amp; have no very precise information from the Insurgent counties I cannot
               decide definitely at this moment whether I shall proceed into them with the Troops,
               or return in time for the meeting of Congress. As soon as I can ascertain the true
               state of the Troops &amp; other matters at this place I intend to proceed to Williamsport,
               &amp; probably from thence to Fort Cumberland and Bedford; at one or other of which my
               ulterior resolution must be taken and in either case communications must be prepared
               for the meeting of Congress” (NIC). By 9 Oct. he had decided to go on with the army
               at least as far as Bedford and ordered Bartholomew Dandridge to request that Henry
               Knox send on “sundry Articles such as tents, &amp;ampca; &amp;ampca;” Knox was to forward
               only such articles “as you conceive will be absolutely necessary for the President’s
               accommodation. . . . As the President will be going, if he proceeds, into the Country
               of Whiskey he proposes to make use of that liquor for his drink, and presuming that
               beef and bread will be furnished by the contractors he requires no supply of these
               Articles from you” (Dandridge to Knox, 9 Oct. 1794, List of Supplies, 11 Oct. 1794,
               and GW to Daniel Morgan, 8 Oct. 1794, DLC:GW).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> On 6 Oct. the citizens of Carlisle presented an address to GW, supporting the laws
               of the United States. The address and GW’s reply are in DLC:GW. See also Gaz. of the

      <p><strong><span class="note">2 After an outstanding military career during the Revolution, Edward Hand (see entry
               for 3 July 1791) resumed the practice of medicine. In GW’s view he was “a sensible
               and judicious man . . . and was esteemed a pretty good Officer. But, if I collect
               rightly, not a very active one” (WRITINGS, 31:510).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> On 8 Oct. there was a general review of the New Jersey horse “at a sight of which
               the President was pleased to express his great satisfaction” (FORD [6], 85).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> 3 On 2 Oct. a meeting was held at Parkinson’s Ferry, composed largely of the same
               individuals as the 14 Aug. meeting. Its members agreed to a series of conciliatory
               resolutions in an effort to prevent the army from marching into the insurgent counties
               and sent two emissaries to present the resolutions to GW at Carlisle (GALLATIN, 22–23).
               For the resolutions and a description of the Parkinson’s Ferry meeting, see BRACKENRIDGE
               [1], 253–54.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">William Findley (d. 1821), one of the meeting’s representatives, was born in Ireland,
               immigrated to the United States, and settled in Westmoreland County, Pa., soon after
               the Revolution. He served in the Pennsylvania legislature, in the 1790 state constitutional
               convention, and in 1791 was elected to the United States House of Representatives
               where he became a vigorous opponent of administration policies (Pa. Archives, 2d ser.,
               4:41n). His colleague, David Redick (d. 1805), also a native of Ireland, had settled
               in Washington County, Pa., where he began the practice of law in 1782. He was a member
               of the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council 1786, vice-president of the state 1788–89,
               and prothonotary of Washington County in 1794 (Pa. Archives, 2d ser., 4:39n).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">Findley and Redick approached Carlisle with some apprehension, having heard on their
               way “alarming accounts of the army, rendezvoused at that place, being very ungovernable
               and exceedingly inflamed against the people of the western country indiscriminately”;
               they were even strongly advised by nearby residents not to venture into the town.
               After their arrival in the [188]town, “having early in the morning waited on the President
               to deliver the papers, and obtained an appointment for an interview, we withdrew in
               a short time. This was to have been expected; it was about seven o’clock; but before
               ten the report was current through both the town and the army, that the President
               had driven us out in six minutes, and was not to see us again; and notwithstanding
               the President’s established character for discretion and politeness, and the frequent
               interviews to which we were admitted, this ridiculous story was believed by many in
               the army” (FINDLEY, 140–42). When they met GW to deliver the resolutions, he was alone
               and received them well. After a short conversation he informed them he had some pressing
               duties and after breakfast “was going to see a division of the army march” but would
               see them at ten. For Findley’s account of the succeeding meeting, much more detailed
               than GW’s, see FINDLEY, 169–89. As the second meeting drew to a close, the representatives
               expressed a wish that GW would remain with the army if it continued on its western
               march. “He replied on this occasion, that if when at Bedford he discovered that his
               presence would be necessary, and he was not under the necessity of returning to Philadelphia,
               he possibly would stay with the army, if it advanced into the western country.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> “I do not pretend that we were treated with attention, from any peculiar attachment
               to us, whether that was so or not is a matter of no importance in this case. The attention
               however that he paid to us was the result of sound discretion. He was anxious to prevent
               bloodshed, and at the same time to enforce due submission to the laws, with as little
               trouble as possible. . . . The President was very sensible of the inflammatory and
               ungovernable disposition that had discovered itself in the army before he arrived
               at Carlisle, and he had not only laboured incessantly to remove that spirit and prevent
               its effects, but he was solicitous also to remove our fears. As often as we suggested
               apprehensions of danger from that quarter, he consoled us with assurances of good
               discipline and subordination to the laws being enforced, and of the disorderly corps
               being dispersed among such as were more orderly, or if that would not do, that they
               should be discharged with infamy. Orders were actually given to this effect, and at
               least in some instances punctually executed” (FINDLEY, 187–88).</span></strong></p>

               the civilian population, see BRACKENRIDGE [2], pt.2, 30–33; FORD [6], 84; FINDLEY,
               143–44.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> Findley was correct in believing that other, and contradictory, versions of the meeting
               were circulating. Capt. David Ford of the New Jersey militia noted that the “committee
               consisted of the damned scoundrel Finley, who most certainly was the first founder
               of the opposition to law in the four western counties, and of a Mr. Reddick. . . .
               The President received them; coldly told them he was determined . . . to march the
               army to the seat of rebellion, and told them, if they met with the least resistance,
               he would not answer for the consequences. This stern reply seemed to discompose the
               old villan, and to please every federalist” (FORD [6], 86).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> 4 David Bradford, one of the most popular and vocal of the insurgent leaders, was
               a native of Maryland but moved to Washington County, Pa., in 1773 or 1774 and was
               admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1783. He was elected to the Pennsylvania General
               Assembly in 1792. Bradford, who was specifically exempted from the amnesty extended
               to the other insurgents [189]after order was restored, eventually fled to Louisiana
               (Pa. Archives, 2d ser., 4:333–34; MULKEARN AND PUGH, 322).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">5 William Macpherson (1756–1813), a native of Philadelphia, was a graduate of Princeton.
               He had served as an officer in the British army before the Revolution but joined the
               Continental Army in 1779. In Sept. 1789 GW appointed him surveyor for the port of
               Philadelphia; in 1792, Philadelphia port inspector; and in 1793, Philadelphia naval
               officer (EXECUTIVE JOURNAL, 1:25, 104, 143, 144). During the Whiskey Insurrection
               he was in command of a battalion of Philadelphia volunteers called “Macpherson’s Blues”
               (Pa. Archives, 2d ser., 4:317).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> 6 Francis Gurney (1738–1815), a native of Bucks County, Pa., served in the French
               and Indian War, and as a colonel with Pennsylvania troops during the Revolution. After
               the war he became a merchant in Philadelphia and for a time was warden of the post
               of Philadelphia, a Philadelphia alderman, and a member of the city council (Pa. Mag.,
               47 [1923], 175–76). In 1794 he was in command of the 1st Regiment of the Philadelphia
               Brigade with the rank of colonel. Apparently Gurney had considerable difficulty maintaining
               discipline among his troops, for GW wrote Hamilton, 26 Oct., on his way back to Philadelphia,
               that “I heard great complaints of Gurney’s Corps (&amp; some of the Artillery) along the
               road to Strasburgh. . . . In some places, I was told they did not leave a plate, a
               spoon, a glass or a knife; and this owing, in a great measure I was informed, to their
               being left without Officers. At most if not all the encampments, I found the fences
               in a manner burnt up. I pray you to mention this to Govr. Mifflin” (DLC: Hamilton

               as a child and was apprenticed to his uncle, William Dunlap, a prominent Philadelphia
               printer. In 1771 he became printer of the Pennsylvania Packet and in 1784 joined with
               David C. Claypoole to publish the paper as a daily. Dunlap &amp; Claypoole were printers
               to the Continental Congress during the Confederation and in 1794 were publishing the
               Daily Advertiser in Philadelphia. Dunlap had served in the 1st Troop of Philadelphia

               was repressed, he remained in command of some 1,500 troops which remained in western

      <p>From the City of <strong><span class="city">Philadelphia</span></strong>, or rather from <strong><span class="city">Norris Town</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Reading</span></strong> the road passes over a reddish, &amp; slaty, or shelly kind of land, through a very open
         and hilly Country, tolerably well cultivated by the farmers. The farm houses are good,
         and their Barns above mediocrity—The former chiefly of Stone. The whole Road indeed
         from <strong><span class="state">Philadelphia</span></strong> to <strong><span class="state">Reading</span></strong> goes over Hilly &amp; broken grounds—but very pleasant notwithstanding.

         South Mountain). For a few miles before we arrived at <strong><span class="city">Shippensbg</span></strong>. the Lands were good, but uncultivated. The improvements along this road were mean;
         the farms scattered; the houses but indifferent; and the husbandry apparently bad.
         Along the Road which the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> Marched, both the land &amp; the Improvements I was told are much better. The Roads came
         together again at the East end of the Town.
      </p>
      
      <p>  From <strong><span class="city">Shippensburgh</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Chambersburgh</span></strong>, the Road passes over pretty good land; better, (but not well) cultivated than that
         betwn. <strong><span class="city">Carlisle</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="city">Shippensburgh</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>From <strong><span class="city">Chambersburgh</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong> the Lands are fine, and the Houses and improvements amended, considerably.

      <p><strong><span class="note"> Greencastle was 11 miles southwest of Chambersburg, in Franklin County, and consisted

      <p> From Shippensburg to Bedford the army was able to make use of a well-kept state road,

About Seven oclock, or half after it, we left <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong>; and travelling upon the <strong><span class="state">Maryland</span></strong> side of the River, we breakfasted at one [      ] 13 miles on our way—&amp; crossing
         the Potomac a mile or two below <strong><span class="city">Hancock Town</span></strong> lodged at the <strong><span class="city">Warm Springs</span></strong>; or Bath; 16 miles from our breakfasting stage—and 29 from <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong>.

      <p><strong><span class="note">Johann David Schoepf described his trip through this region as a journey “through
               fertile valleys and over a few barren hills, consisting wholly of limestone soil and

               place begun shortly before the war and numbering only a dozen houses. It belongs to
               Maryland which province here runs very narrow, for but a mile and a half from the

      <p><strong><span class="date">15th.</span></strong> Left Bath by seven oclock; &amp; crossing the Cacapohon Mountain, &amp; the Potomack River
         by a very rough road, we breakfasted at one Goldens—distant about 7 Miles—Bated our
         horses at a very indifferent place abt. 13 Miles further on—and lodged at the Old
         Town 33 or 34 Miles. This distance from the extreme [192] badness of the Road, more
         than half of it being very hilly, &amp; great part of it Stoney, was a severe days Journey
         for the Carriage horses; they performed it however, well.

               From 1790 to 1792 he served in the Maryland House of Delegates. In 1793 he was elected

      <p><strong><span class="note">Dr. Robert Wellford of Fredericksburg, who was with the Virginia troops, noted in
               his diary GW’s arrival at Cumberland: “Between eleven &amp; twelve o’clock this day arrived
               the President of the United States escorted into the town &amp; to Head Quarters near
               the Fort by three troops of light dragoons, every man of whom cheerfully left ye encampment
               to pay the President a compliment, every regiment was drawn up in excellent order
               to receive him, &amp; as he passed the line of Infantry he deliberately bowed to every
               officer individually. The Artillery at the same time announced his arrival” (WELLFORD,
               7).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">17th.</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="date">18th</span></strong>. Remained at <strong><span class="city">Cumberland</span></strong>, in order to acquire a true knowledge of the strength—condition—&amp;ampca; of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong>; and to see how they were provided, and when they could be got in readiness to proceed.
      </p>
      
      <p> I found upwards of 3200 Men (Officers included) in this Encampment; Understood that
         about 500 more were at a little [193] Village on the <strong><span class="state">Virginia</span></strong> side, 11 Miles distant, called <strong><span class="city">Frankfort</span></strong>, under the command of <strong><span class="persName">Majr.

Page</span></strong> and That the whole were well supplied with Provns., Forage &amp; Straw.
      </p>
      
      <p> Having requested that every thing might be speedily arranged for a forward movement,
         and a light Corps to be organized for the advance under the command of <strong><span class="persName">Major Genl. Morgan</span></strong>, I resolved to proceed to <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong> next Morng.
      </p>
      
      <p> At this place a deputation was received from the County of <strong><span class="city">Fayette</span></strong> consisting of a <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Mason</span></strong> [      ] <strong><span class="persName">Terrence</span></strong> and [      ] <strong><span class="persName">Clinton</span></strong> who came to give assurances that deposits for the Army might safely be made in that
         County, and any person sent from it for this purpose would be safe in doing it.
      </p>
      
      <p> They were desired to get there wheat ground up, and their Oats threshed out, to be
         in readiness to be drawn to any place, or places that might be required after the
         <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> had crossed the Mountains.
      </p>
      
      <p> From <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Mason</span></strong> (who has been a uniform friend to Government) and from a variety of concurrant accounts,
         it appears evident that the people in the Western Counties of this State have got
         very much alarmed at the approach of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>; but though Submission is professed, their principles remain the same; and that nothing
         but coercion, &amp; example will reclaim &amp; bring them to a due &amp; unequivocal submission
         to the Laws.

      <p> <strong><span class="date">19th</span></strong>. In company with <strong><span class="persName">Genl.

         fixed, that the whole might move in Unison—and accompanied by the Adjutant General
         and my own family we set out, abt. eight oclock, for <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>, and making one halt at the distance of 12 Miles, reached it a little after 4 oclock
         in the afternoon being met a little out of the Encampment by <strong><span class="persName">Govr. Mifflin</span></strong>—<strong><span class="persName">Govr. Howell</span></strong>—&amp; several other Officers of distinction.
      </p>
      
      <p> Quarters were provided for me at the House of a <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Espy</span></strong>. [194] Prothonotary of the County of <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>—to which I was carried &amp; lodged very comfortably.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Road from <strong><span class="city">Cumberld</span></strong>. to this place is, in places, stoney but in other respects not bad. It passes through
         a Valley the whole way; and was opened by <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> under my command in the Autumn of <strong><span class="date">1758</span></strong>. The whole Valley consists of good farming land, &amp; part of it—next <strong><span class="city">Cumberland</span></strong>—is tolerably well improved in its culture but not much so in Houses.
      </p>
      
      <p> On <strong><span class="date">19 Oct</span></strong>., <strong><span class="persName">Dr. Wellford</span></strong> noted in his diary that <strong><span class="quote">“this morning the President of the United States set out for Bedford on his return
               to the right wing of the Army, &amp; from there to the seat of Government. . . . The Cavalry
               this morning escorted the President about five miles from (camp), when he requested
               the Troops to return, &amp; taking leave spoke to Major George Lewis as follows: ‘George,
               You are the eldest of five nephews that I have in this Army, let your conduct be an
               example to them, and do not turn your back until you are ordered.’</span></strong> <strong><span class="persName">Major Lewis</span></strong> made a suitable reply, but from this address of the President it was conjectured
         that the Troops would not be entirely disbanded at the end of the three months’ service.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">“Mem: The President’s five nephews are Major George Lewis, Commandant of the Cavalry.

               Mercer’s troop. and Mr. Saml. Washington (son of Col. Ch’s Washington), and Mr. Laurence
               Washington (son of Col. Saml. Washington), both of whom are light horsemen in the
               troop lately commanded by Capt. Lewis” (WELLFORD, 8–9). At this time Bedford, some
               110 miles west of Philadelphia, contained 41 log and 9 stone dwellings, a brick market
               house, a stone jail, a courthouse, and a brick building for keeping the records of
               the county (SCOTT [2]). “The President’s reception at Bedford on his return to the
               seat of Government was affectionate and interesting,” Dr. Wellford continued. “When
               it was announced that He was approaching, the troops &amp; the artillery paraded, the
               Cavalry marched down the road two miles, &amp; drew up on the right of the road. As General
               Washington passed he pulled off his hat, &amp;, in the most respectful manner, bowed to
               the officers &amp; men, and in this manner passed the line, who were affected by the sight
               of their Chief, for whom each individual seemed to show the affectionate regard that
               would have been to an honoured Parent. As soon as the President passed, his escort
               followed the Troops, joined the train, &amp; entered the town, whose inhabitants seemed
               anxious to see this very great and good Man. Crowds were assembled in the streets,
               but their admiration was silent. In this manner the President passed in front of the
               Camp, where the troops were assembled in front of the Tents. the line of Artillery
               Horse &amp; Infantry appeared in the most perfect order, the greatest silence was observed.
               Genl. Washington approached the right uncovered, passed along the line bowing in the
               most respectful &amp; affectionate manner to the officers—he appeared pleased” (WELLFORD,
               9–10).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note">David Espy was one of Bedford’s first settlers. His house was “a two-story stone structure
               with three windows across the front and a high hipped roof giving almost a full floor
               in the attic.” The house had been used by Arthur St. Clair when he was prothonotary
               of Bedford County (MULKEARN AND PUGH, 130, 139). road: For GW’s route to join Gen.

      <p>[195]</p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">20th</span></strong>. Called the Quarter Master General, Adjutant General, Contractor, &amp; others of the Staff departmt. before me, &amp; the Commander in chief, at 9 Oclock this morning, in order to fix on the Routs of the two Columns &amp; their
         Stages; and to know what the situation of matters were in their respective departments—and
         when they wd. be able to put the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> in motion. Also to obtain a correct return of the strength—and to press the commanding
         Officers of Corps to prepare with all the Celerity in their power for a forward movement.
      </p>
      
      <p> Upon comparing accts., it was found that the <strong><span class="USmilitary">army</span></strong> could be put in motion 23d.—and it was so ordered, by the Routs which will be mentioned
         hereafter.
      </p>
      
      <p> Matters being thus arranged I wrote a farewell address to the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> through the Commander in Chief—<strong><span class="persName">Govr. Lee</span></strong>—to be published in orders—and having prepared his Instructions and made every arrangement
         that occurred, as necessary I prepared for my return to <strong><span class="city">Philadelphia</span></strong> in order to meet <strong><span class="political">Congress</span></strong>, and to attend to the Civil duties of my Office.
      </p>
      
      <p>I should have mentioned before that I found (on my arrival at <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>) the judge, and Attorney for the district of <strong><span class="state">Pennsylvania</span></strong> attending, as they had been required to do, the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> I found also, which appeared to me to be an unlucky measure—that the former had issued
         his warrants against, and a party of light horse had actually siez’d, one Harman Husband
         &amp; one Filson as <strong><span class="military">Insurgents</span></strong> or abetters of the Insurrection. I call it unlucky because my intention was to have
         suspended all proceedings of a Civil Nature until the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> had united its columns in the Center of the Insurgent Counties &amp; then to have ciezed
         at one &amp; the same all the leaders and principals of the Insurrection and because it
         is to be feared that the proceeding above mentioned will have given the alarm and
         those who are most obnoxious to punishment will flee from the Country.
