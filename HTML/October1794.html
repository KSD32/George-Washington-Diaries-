         was intended. I got off in time, however, to make a halt (to bait my horses) at <strong><span class="city">Womeldorfs</span></strong> <strong><span class="note">[2]</span></strong> 14 miles and to view the Canal from <strong><span class="city">Myers town</span></strong> <strong><span class="note">[3]</span></strong> towards <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong>—and the Locks between the two places; which (four adjoining each other, in the dissent
         from the Summit ground along the Tulpihockin; built of Brick;) appeared admirably
         constructed. Reached <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong> <strong><span class="note">[4]</span></strong> at Night 28 miles.

                     church, united”</span></strong> (SCOTT [2]). Clunn counted <strong><span class="quote">“about 50 Houses mostly built of log. The Church was built by the Lutheran’s &amp; Presbyterian’s
                     for their joint use”</span></strong> (CLUNN, 48).</span></strong></p>

The canal was
               part of a construction project of the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Navigation Company
               and connected Quitipihilla Creek and Tulpehocken Creek (Pa. Mag., 71 [1947], 48, n.25).
               <strong><span class="persName">Quartermaster John Hugg Clunn</span></strong> of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">New Jersey militia</span></strong>, visiting the area on <strong><span class="date">8 Oct. 1794</span></strong>, found <strong><span class="city">Myerstown</span></strong> to be <strong><span class="quote">“a Village built of Log.

                     Irishman . . . very humbly pulld of his Hatt and asked if I knew the Custom when Gent.
                     came to see the Works. I saw plainly it was 2/ out of my pocket &amp; without further
                     ceremony gave it him—took another look thought it worth 4/”</span></strong> (CLUNN, 48). Another New Jersey officer noted that the <strong><span class="quote">“canal is already dug ten miles, in which are five locks, to embrace thirty feet;
                     that they are executed in a masterly manner—that in the distance already done there
                     is a great number of elegant arched bridges over the canal, wherever it goes across
                     the road. There are now employed 600 hands at it, and every prospect of succeeding
                     in this part of the bold enterprise” </span></strong>(FORD [6], 81).</span></strong></p> 
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> 4.<strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong>, in Dauphin County, at this time consisted of 2 churches and about 40 houses, mostly

      </p>
      
      <p>At<strong><span class="city"> Harrisburgh</span></strong> we found the first <strong><span class="USmilitary">Regiment of New Jersey</span></strong> (about 560 strong) commd. by <strong><span class="persName">Colo.

         Town which is considerable for its age (of about 8 or 9 years). The Susquehanna at
         this place abounds in the Rockfish of 12 or 15 Inches in length &amp; a fish which they
         call Salmon.

               Adv. [Philadelphia], 17 Oct. 1794).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> 11. At <strong><span class="city">Carlisle</span></strong>, <strong><span class="persName">GW </span></strong>found a town <strong><span class="quote">“regularly laid out, consisting of several parallel streets, crossed by others at

During the <strong><span class="AmericanRevolution">Revolution</span></strong>, <strong><span class="USmilitary">Carlisle Barracks</span></strong> had been an ordnance depot and in <strong><span class="date">1791</span></strong> had been designated as a general rendezvous for federal troops and supplies. It is
               estimated that during the insurrection between 10,000 and 15,000 troops encamped on
               the common (TOUSEY, 164–65).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> 12. There was “the greatest vieing between the New Jersey and Pennsylvania horse,”
               <strong><span class="persName">Captain Ford</span></strong> of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">New Jersey troops</span></strong> noted, as to <strong><span class="quote">“who should be first on the ground to receive the President. At ten o’clock, the signal
                     for mounting came, and away went the horse”</span></strong> (FORD [6], 85). At 12 o’clock it was announced that the president was approaching.

                     [182] by the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Jersey cavalry</span></strong> in great numbers. We were drawn up on the right of the road, when our beloved <strong><span class="persName">Washington</span></strong> approached on horseback in a traveling dress, attended by his Secretary, &amp;c. As he
                     passed our troop, he pulled off his hat, and in the most respectful manner bowed to
                     the officers and men; and in this manner passed the line. . . . As soon as the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> passed, his escort followed, we joined the train, and entered the town whose inhabitants
                     seemed anxious to see this very great and good man; crowds were assembled in the streets,
                     but their admiration was silent. In this manner the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> passed to the front of the camp, where the troops were assembled in front of the
                     tents; the line of artillery, horse and infantry, appeared in the most perfect order;
                     the greatest silence was observed”</span></strong> (“Notes on the March from September 30, until October 29, 1794,” Pa. Archives, 2d

Something of a poet, <strong><span class="persName">Howell</span></strong> is credited with having composed the stanzas in honor of <strong><span class="persName">GW</span></strong> for the president’s reception at Assanpink Bridge on his way to <strong><span class="city">New York</span></strong> in <strong><span class="date">April 1789</span></strong> (see also AGNEW, 221–30).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">5th.</span></strong>—Sunday. Went to the Presbiterian Meeting <strong><span class="note">[15]</span></strong> and heard <strong><span class="persName">Doctr.

      <p><strong><span class="note">15.The <strong><span class="religious">First Presbyterian Church of Carlisle</span></strong> was on the northeast corner of the town’s center square.

In a sermon of <strong><span class="date">28 Sept. 1794</span></strong> he had railed against the <strong><span class="quote">“sinners”</span></strong> who had taken up arms against their government. <strong><span class="quote">“But if they will resist, and involve themselves in the guilt of rebellion, they deserve
                     not to be pitied nor spared”</span></strong> (BALDWIN [3], 226).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">6th. to the 12th</span></strong>. Employed in Organizing the several detachments, which had come in from different
         Counties of this State, in a very disjointed &amp; loose manner; or rather I ought to
         have said in urging &amp; assisting <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Mifflin</span></strong> to do it; as I no otherwise took the command of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> than to press them forward, and to provide them with necessaries for their March,
         as well, &amp; as far, as our means would admit.<strong><span class="note">[16]</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>[183]</p>
      
      <p>To effect these purposes, I appointed General Hand Adjutant General on the <strong><span class="date">7th</span></strong>.2
      </p>
      
      <p>On the <strong><span class="date">9th</span></strong>. <strong><span class="persName">William Findley</span></strong> and <strong><span class="persName">David Redick</span></strong>—deputed by the Committee of Safety (as it is designated) which met on the <strong><span class="date">2d</span></strong>. of this month at Parkinson Ferry arrived in Camp with the Resolutions of the said

         of <strong><span class="state">Pennsylvania</span></strong> to wit—Washington Fayette Westd. &amp; Alligany in order to see if it would prevent the
         March of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> into them.3
      </p>
      
      <p> At 10 oclock I had a meeting with these persons in presence of <strong><span class="persName">Govr.

      </p>
      
      <p>I told the Deputies that by one of the Resolutions it would appear that they were
         empowered to give information of the disposition &amp; of the existing state of matters
         in the four Counties above men[tioned]; that I was ready to hear &amp; would listen patiently,
         and with candour to what they had to say.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="persName">Mr. Findley</span></strong> began. He confined his information to such parts of the four Counties as he was best
         acquainted with; referring to Mr. Reddick for a recital of what fell within his knowledge,
         in the other parts of these Counties.
      </p>
      
      <p>The substance of<strong><span class="persName"> Mr. Findley</span></strong>s communications were as follows [184] —viz.—That the People in the parts where he
         was best acquainted, had seen there folly; and he believed were disposed to submit
         to the Laws; that he thought, but could not undertake to be responsible, for the re-establishment
         of the public Offices for the Collection of the Taxes on distilled spirits, &amp; Stills—intimating
         however, that it might be best for the present, &amp; until the peoples minds were a little
         more tranquilized, to hold the Office of Inspection at <strong><span class="city">Pitsburgh</span></strong> under the protection—or at least under the influence of the <strong><span class="military">Garrison</span></strong>; That he thought the Distillers would either enter their stills or would put them
         down; That the Civil authority was beginning to recover its tone; &amp; enumerated some
         instances of it; That the ignorance, &amp; general want of information among the people
         far exceeded any thing he had any conception of; That it was not merely the excise
         law their opposition was aimed at, but to all law, &amp; Government; and to the Officers
         of Government; and that the situation in which he had been, &amp; the life he had led
         for sometime, was such, that rather than go through it again, he would prefer quitting
         this scene altogether.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Redicks</span></strong> information was similar to the above; except as to the three last recitals—on wch.
         I do not recollect that he expressed any sentiment further than that the situation
         of those who were not in the opposition to government whilst the frenzy was at its
         height, were obliged to sleep with their Arms by their bed Sides every night; not
         knowing but that before Morning they might have occasion to use them in defence of
         their persons, or their properties.
      </p>
      
      <p>He added, that for a long time after the riots commenced, and until lately, the distrust
         of one another was such, that even friends were affraid to communicate their sentiments
         to each other; That by whispers this was brought about; and growing bolder as they
         became more communicative they found their strength, and that there was a general
         disposition not only to acquiesce under, but to support the Laws—and he gave some
         instances also of Magistrates enforcing them.
      </p>
      
      <p>He said the People of those Counties believed that the opposition to the Excise law—or
         at least that their dereliction to it, in every other part of the <strong><span class="nation">U. States</span></strong> was similar to their own, and that no Troops could be got to March against them for
         the purpose of coercion; that every acct. until very lately, of <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> marching against them was disbelieved; &amp; supposed to be the fabricated tales of governmental
         men; That now they had got alarmed; That many were disposing of their property at
         an under rate, in order to leave the Country, and added (I think) that [185] they
         wd. go to <strong><span class="city">Detroit</span></strong>. That no person of any consequence, except one, but what had availed themselves of
         the proffered amnesty; That those who were still in the opposition, and obnoxious
         to the laws, were Men of little or no property, &amp; cared but little where they resided;
         That he did not believe there was the least intention in them to oppose the <strong><span class="nation">Army</span></strong>; &amp; that there was not three rounds of ammunition for them in all the Western Country.
         He (&amp; I think Mr. Findley also) was apprehensive that the resentments of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> might be productive of treatment to some of these people that might be attended with
         disagreeable consequences; &amp; on that account seemed to deprecate the March of it:
         declaring however, that it was their wish, if the people did not give proofs of unequivocal
         submission, that it might not stop short of its object.
      </p>
      
      <p>After hearing what both had to say, I briefly told them—That it had been the earnest
         wish of governmt. to bring the people of those counties to a sense of their duty,
         by mild, &amp; lenient means; That for the purpose of representing to their sober reflection
         the fatal consequences of such conduct Commissioners had been sent amongst them that
         they might be warned, in time, of what must follow, if they persevered in their opposition
         to the laws; but that coercion wou’d not be resorted to except in the dernier resort:
         but, that the season of the year made it indispensible that preparation for it should
         keep pace with the propositions that had been made; That it was unnecessary for me
         to enumerate the transactions of those people (as they related to the proceedings
         of government) forasmuch as they knew them as well as I did; That the measure which
         they were not witness to the adoption of was not less painful than expensive—Was inconvenient,
         &amp; distressing—in every point of view; but as I considered the support of the Laws
         as an object of the first magnitude, and the greatest part of the expense had already
         been incurred, that nothing Short of the most unequivocal proofs of absolute Submission
         should retard the March of the army into the Western counties, in order to convince
         them that the government could, &amp; would enforce obedience to the laws—not suffering
         them to be insulted with impunity. Being asked again what proofs would be required,
         I answered, they knew as well as I did, what was due to justice &amp; example. They understood
         my meaning—and asked if they might have another interview. I appointed five oclock
         in the After noon for it. At this second Meeting there was little more than a repeti[ti]on
         of what had passed in the forenoon; and it being again mentioned that all the principal
         characters, except one, in the Western counties who had been in the opposition, had
         submitted [186] to the propositions—I was induced, seeing them in the Street the next
         day, to ask <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Redick</span></strong> who that one was?—telling him at the same time I required no disclosure that he did
         not feel himself entirely free to make. He requested a little time to think of it,
         and asked for another meeting—which was appointed at 5 oclock that afternoon—which
         took place accordingly when he said <strong><span class="persName">David Bradford</span></strong>4 was the person he had alluded to in his former conversations.
      </p>
      
      <p>He requested to know if a Meeting of the people, by their deputies, would be permitted
         by the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> at any given point, on their March into that Country (with fresh evidence of the
         sincerity of their disposition to acquiesce in whatever might be required). I replied
         I saw no objection to it, provided they came unarmed; but to be cautious that not
         a gun was fired, as there could be no answering for consequences in this case. I assured
         them that every possible care should be taken to keep the <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> from offering them any insult or damage and that those who always had been subordinate
         to the Laws, &amp; such as had availed themselves of the amnesty, should not be injured
         in their persons or property; and that the treatment of the rest would depend upon
         their own conduct. That the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>, unless opposed, did not mean to act as executioners, or bring offenders to a <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military Tribunal</span></strong>; but merely to aid the civil Megistrates, with whom offences would lye.

      <p><strong><span class="editorsWash"><strong><span class="persName">Findley</span></strong> and <strong><span class="persName">Redick</span></strong> approached <strong><span class="city">Carlisle</span></strong> with some apprehension, having heard on their way <strong><span class="quote">“alarming accounts of the army, rendezvoused at that place, being very ungovernable
                     and exceedingly inflamed against the people of the western country indiscriminately”</span></strong>; they were even strongly advised by nearby residents not to venture into the town.
               After their arrival in the [188]town, <strong><span class="quote">“having early in the morning waited on the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> to deliver the papers, and obtained an appointment for an interview, we withdrew
                     in a short time. This was to have been expected; it was about seven o’clock; but before
                     ten the report was current through both the town and the army, that the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> had driven us out in six minutes, and was not to see us again; and notwithstanding
                     the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong>’s established character for discretion and politeness, and the frequent interviews
                     to which we were admitted, this ridiculous story was believed by many in the army”</span></strong> (FINDLEY, 140–42). When they met <strong><span class="persName">GW</span></strong> to deliver the resolutions, he was alone and received them well. After a short conversation
               he informed them he had some pressing duties and after breakfast <strong><span class="quote">“was going to see a division of the army march”</span></strong> but would see them at ten. For <strong><span class="persName">Findley</span></strong>’s account of the succeeding meeting, much more detailed than <strong><span class="persName">GW</span></strong>’s, see FINDLEY, 169–89. As the second meeting drew to a close, the representatives
               expressed a wish that <strong><span class="persName">GW</span></strong>would remain with the army if it continued on its western march. <strong><span class="quote">“He replied on this occasion, that if when at Bedford he discovered that his presence
                     would be necessary, and he was not under the necessity of returning to Philadelphia,
                     he possibly would stay with the army, if it advanced into the western country.</span></strong></span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="editorsWash"><strong><span class="quote">“I do not pretend that we were treated with attention, from any peculiar attachment

                     however that he paid to us was the result of sound discretion. He was anxious to prevent
                     bloodshed, and at the same time to enforce due submission to the laws, with as little
                     trouble as possible. . . . The <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> was very sensible of the inflammatory and ungovernable disposition that had discovered
                     itself in the army before he arrived at <strong><span class="persName">Carlisle</span></strong>, and he had not only laboured incessantly to remove that spirit and prevent its effects,
                     but he was solicitous also to remove our fears. As often as we suggested apprehensions
                     of danger from that quarter, he consoled us with assurances of good discipline and
                     subordination to the laws being enforced, and of the disorderly corps being dispersed
                     among such as were more orderly, or if that would not do, that they should be discharged
                     with infamy. Orders were actually given to this effect, and at least in some instances
                     punctually executed”</span></strong> (FINDLEY, 187–88).</span></strong></p>

                     This default was severely censured by the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong>”</span></strong> (FORD [6], 86).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">12th.

      <p><strong><span class="note"> <strong><span class="city">Chambersburg</span></strong>, in Franklin County, about 150 miles west of <strong><span class="city">Philadelphia</span></strong>, consisted of <strong><span class="quote">“one long street, on which are erected about 200 dwellings, two <strong><span class="religious">Presbyterian churches</span></strong>, a stone jail, and handsome brick court-house, a paper and a merchant mill”</span></strong> (SCOTT [2]). According to local tradition, <strong><span class="persName">GW</span></strong> may have lodged tonight with <strong><span class="persName">Dr. Robert Johnson</span></strong>, a surgeon in the <strong><span class="state">Pennsylvania</span></strong> line during the <strong><span class="AmericanRevolution">Revolution</span></strong> (EGLE [2], 1st–2d ser., 1:225).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">13th</span></strong>. Breakfasted at <strong><span class="city">Greencastle</span></strong> 10 Miles, &amp; lodged at <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong>, 14 Miles further.
      </p>
      
      <p>Having now passed thro’ the States of <strong><span class="state">Pennsylvania</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="state">Maryland</span></strong>, <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong> being on the Banks of the Potomac, at the Mouth of Conogocheaque; I shall summarily notice the kind of land, &amp; State
         of improvements, along the Road I have come.
      </p>
      
      <p> From the City of<strong><span class="city"> Philadelphia</span></strong>, or rather from <strong><span class="city">Norris Town</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Reading</span></strong> the road passes over a reddish, &amp; slaty, or shelly kind of land, through a very open
         and hilly Country, tolerably well cultivated by the farmers. The farm houses are good,
         and their Barns above mediocrity—The former chiefly of Stone. The whole Road indeed
         from Philadelphia to Reading goes over Hilly &amp; broken grounds—but very pleasant notwithstanding.
      </p>
      
      <p> From <strong><span class="city">Reading</span></strong> to Lebanon, along what is called the Valley, the Country is extremely fine—The lands
         rich—The Agriculture good—as the buildings also are, especially their Barns, which
         are large &amp; fine; and for the most part of Stone. This settlement is chiefly of <strong><span class="nation">Dutch</span></strong>, and upon the Tulpahocken.
      </p>
      
      <p> From <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Harrisburgh</span></strong>, along the same Vale, the Lands are also good; but not in so high a state of cultivation
         as between <strong><span class="city">Reading</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="city">Lebanon</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> From <strong><span class="city">Harrisburgh</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Carlisle</span></strong> the lands are exceedingly fine, [191] but not under such cultivation &amp; improvement
         as one might have expected.
      </p>
      
      <p> From <strong><span class="city">Carlisle</span></strong> along the left Road, which I pursued, to be out of the March of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>, and to avoid the inconvenience of passing the Waggons belonging to it; the Lands
         are but indifferent until we came within a few miles of <strong><span class="city">Shippensburgh</span></strong>—The first part of a thin and dry Soil, succeeded by piney flats (not far from the
         South Mountain). For a few miles before we arrived at <strong><span class="city">Shippensbg.</span></strong> the Lands were good, but uncultivated. The improvements along this road were mean;
         the farms scattered; the houses but indifferent; and the husbandry apparently bad.
         Along the Road which the Troops Marched, both the land &amp; the Improvements I was told
         are much better. The Roads came together again at the East end of the Town.
      </p>
      
      <p>From <strong><span class="city">Shippensburgh</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Chambersburgh</span></strong>, the Road passes over pretty good land; better, (but not well) cultivated than that
         betwn. <strong><span class="city">Carlisle</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="city">Shippensburgh</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>From <strong><span class="city">Chambersburgh</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong> the Lands are fine, and the Houses and improvements amended, considerably.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="city">Greencastle</span></strong> was 11 miles southwest of <strong><span class="city">Chambersburg</span></strong>, in <strong><span class="city">Franklin County</span></strong>, and consisted of about 80 houses and 2 churches (SCOTT [2]).
      </p>
      
      <p>From <strong><span class="city">Shippensburg</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong> the <strong><span class="military">army</span></strong> was able to make use of a well-kept state road, generally following the route of
         Forbes Road, constructed during the French and Indian War (CLUNN, 50, n.38).
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">14th</span></strong>. About Seven oclock, or half after it, we left <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong>; and travelling upon the <strong><span class="state">Maryland</span></strong> side of the River, we breakfasted at one [      ] 13 miles on our way—&amp; crossing
         the Potomac a mile or two below <strong><span class="city">Hancock Town</span></strong> lodged at the Warm Springs; or Bath; 16 miles from our breakfasting stage—and 29 from <strong><span class="city">Williamsport</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"><strong><span class="persName">Johann David Schoepf</span></strong> described his trip through this region as a journey <strong><span class="quote">“through fertile valleys and over a few barren hills, consisting wholly of limestone
                     soil and growing almost nothing but white-oaks. I came to <strong><span class="city">Hancocktown</span></strong> on the Potowmack; a small place begun shortly before the war and numbering only a dozen houses. It
                     belongs to <strong><span class="state">Maryland</span></strong> which province here runs very narrow, for but a mile and a half from the town I crossed
                     the boundary-line”</span></strong> (SCHOEPF, 1:308).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">15th</span></strong>. Left Bath by seven oclock; &amp; crossing the Cacapohon Mountain, &amp; the Potomack River by a very rough road, we breakfasted at one Goldens—distant about 7 Miles—Bated our
         horses at a very indifferent place abt. 13 Miles further on—and lodged at the Old
         Town 33 or 34 Miles. This distance from the extreme [192] badness of the Road, more
         than half of it being very hilly, &amp; great part of it Stoney, was a severe days Journey
         for the Carriage horses; they performed it however, well.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">16th</span></strong>. After an early breakfast we set out for <strong><span class="city">Cumberland</span></strong>—and about 11 Oclock arrived there.
      </p>
      
      <p>Three miles from the Town I was met by a party of Horse under the command of <strong><span class="persName">Major Lewis</span></strong> (my Nephew) and by <strong><span class="persName">Brigr. Genl. Smith</span></strong> of the <strong><span class="state">Maryland</span></strong> line, who Escorted me to the Camp; where, finding all the <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> under Arms, I passed along the line of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>; &amp; was conducted to a house the residence of <strong><span class="persName">Major Lynn</span></strong> of the <strong><span class="state">Maryland</span></strong> line (an old Continental Officer) where I was well lodged, &amp; civily entertained.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="city">Cumberland</span></strong>, <strong><span class="state">Md</span></strong>., was the rendezvous for the <strong><span class="USmilitary">militia</span></strong> from <strong><span class="state">Maryland</span></strong> and <strong><span class="state">Virginia</span></strong>; the <strong><span class="state">Pennsylvania </span></strong>and <strong><span class="state">New Jersey</span></strong> <strong><span class="USmilitary">militia</span></strong> were to rendezvous at <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>, <strong><span class="state">Pa</span></strong>.

      <p><strong><span class="note"><strong><span class="persName">George Lewis</span></strong> (see entry for 3 April 1785) was now a <strong><span class="MilOfficer">captain</span></strong> in command of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Fredericksburg Troop of Volunteers</span></strong>.

From <strong><span class="date">1790</span></strong> to <strong><span class="date">1792</span></strong> he served in the <strong><span class="political">Maryland House of Delegates</span></strong>. In <strong><span class="date">1793</span></strong> he was elected as a <strong><span class="political">Democrat</span></strong> to the <strong><span class="political">Third Congress</span></strong> and served until <strong><span class="date">1803</span></strong> when he was elected to the <strong><span class="political">Senate</span></strong>. At this time he was a <strong><span class="MilOfficer">major general</span></strong> in the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Maryland militia</span></strong> (CASSELL, 58–59).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="persName">David Lynn</span></strong> (d. <strong><span class="date">1835</span></strong>) served in various <strong><span class="USmilitary">Maryland regiments</span></strong> from <strong><span class="date">1776</span></strong> to <strong><span class="date">1783</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="persName">Dr. Robert Wellford</span></strong> of <strong><span class="city">Fredericksburg</span></strong>, who was with the<strong><span class="USmilitary">Virginia troops</span></strong>, noted in his diary <strong><span class="persName">GW</span></strong>’s arrival at <strong><span class="city">Cumberland</span></strong>:<strong><span class="quote"> “Between eleven &amp; twelve o’clock this day arrived the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President of the United States</span></strong> escorted into the town &amp; to Head Quarters near the Fort by three <strong><span class="military">troops of light dragoons</span></strong>, every man of whom cheerfully left ye encampment to pay the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> a compliment, every <strong><span class="military">regiment</span></strong> was drawn up in excellent order to receive him, &amp; as he passed the line of <strong><span class="military">Infantry</span></strong> he deliberately bowed to every officer individually. The <strong><span class="military">Artillery </span></strong>at the same time announced his arrival”</span></strong> (WELLFORD, 7).
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">17th</span></strong>. &amp; <strong><span class="date">18th</span></strong>. Remained at <strong><span class="city">Cumberland</span></strong>, in order to acquire a true knowledge of the strength—condition—&amp;ampca;. of the <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong>; and to see how they were provided, and when they could be got in readiness to proceed.
      </p>
      
      <p>I found upwards of 3200 Men (<strong><span class="military">Officers</span></strong> included) in this Encampment; Understood that about 500 more were at a little [193]
         Village on the <strong><span class="state">Virginia</span></strong> side, 11 Miles distant, called <strong><span class="city">Frankfort</span></strong>, under the command of <strong><span class="persName">Majr. Genl. Morgan</span></strong>; that 700 more had arrived at that place the evening of the 18th. undr. <strong><span class="persName">Brigr. Mathews</span></strong> and 500 more were expected in the course of a few days under <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Page</span></strong> and That the whole were well supplied with Provns., Forage &amp; Straw.
      </p>
      
      <p> Having requested that every thing might be speedily arranged for a forward movement,
         and a <strong><span class="military">light Corps</span></strong> to be organized for the advance under the command of <strong><span class="persName">Major Genl. Morgan</span></strong>, I resolved to proceed to <strong><span class="city">Bedford </span></strong>next Morng.
      </p>
      
      <p> At this place a deputation was received from the <strong><span class="city">County of Fayette</span></strong> consisting of a <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Mason</span></strong> [      ] <strong><span class="persName">Terrence</span></strong> and [      ] <strong><span class="persName">Clinton</span></strong> who came to give assurances that deposits for the<strong><span class="USmilitary"> Army</span></strong> might safely be made in that County, and any person sent from it for this purpose
         would be safe in doing it.
      </p>
      
      <p>They were desired to get there wheat ground up, and their Oats threshed out, to be
         in readiness to be drawn to any place, or places that might be required after the
         <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> had crossed the Mountains.
      </p>
      
      <p> From <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Mason</span></strong> (who has been a uniform friend to Government) and from a variety of concurrant accounts,
         it appears evident that the people in the Western Counties of this State have got
         very much alarmed at the approach of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>; but though Submission is professed, their principles remain the same; and that nothing
         but coercion, &amp; example will reclaim &amp; bring them to a due &amp; unequivocal submission
         to the Laws.

               Pa. Clinton may have been Charles Clinton of Union Township, Fayette County. Mason
               may have been Isaac Meason, a Fayette County judge.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">19th</span></strong>. In company with <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Lee</span></strong>, who I requested to attend me, that all the arrangements necessary for the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army’s</span></strong> crossing the Mountns. in two columns might be made; Their routs, &amp; days Marches fixed,
         that the whole might move in Unison—and accompanied by the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Adjutant General</span></strong> and my own family we set out, abt. eight oclock, for <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>, and making one halt at the distance of 12 Miles, reached it a little after 4 oclock
         in the afternoon being met a little out of the Encampment by <strong><span class="persName">Govr. Mifflin</span></strong>—<strong><span class="persName">Govr. Howell</span></strong>—&amp; several other <strong><span class="military">Officers</span></strong> of distinction.
      </p>
      
      <p>Quarters were provided for me at the House of a <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Espy</span></strong>. [194] Prothonotary of the County of <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>—to which I was carried &amp; lodged very comfortably.
      </p>
      
      <p> The Road from <strong><span class="city">Cumberld</span></strong>. to this place is, in places, stoney but in other respects not bad. It passes through
         a Valley the whole way; and was opened by <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> under my command in the Autumn of <strong><span class="date">1758</span></strong>. The whole Valley consists of good farming land, &amp; part of it—next <strong><span class="city">Cumberland</span></strong>—is tolerably well improved in its culture but not much so in Houses.

               and a brick building for keeping the records of the county (SCOTT [2]). <strong><span class="quote">“The <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong>’s reception at <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong> on his return to the seat of Government was affectionate and interesting,” </span></strong><strong><span class="persName">Dr. Wellford</span></strong> continued. <strong><span class="quote">“When it was announced that He was approaching, the <strong><span class="military">troops</span></strong> &amp; the <strong><span class="military">artillery</span></strong> paraded, the <strong><span class="military">Cavalry</span></strong> marched down the road two miles, &amp; drew up on the right of the road. As <strong><span class="persName">General Washington</span></strong> passed he pulled off his hat, &amp;, in the most respectful manner, bowed to the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">officers</span></strong> &amp; men, and in this manner passed the line, who were affected by the sight of their
                     Chief, for whom each individual seemed to show the affectionate regard that would
                     have been to an honoured Parent. As soon as the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> passed, his escort followed the <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong>, joined the train, &amp; entered the town, whose inhabitants seemed anxious to see this
                     very great and good Man. Crowds were assembled in the streets, but their admiration
                     was silent. In this manner the <strong><span class="USpolitical">President</span></strong> passed in front of the Camp, where the <strong><span class="military">troops</span></strong> were assembled in front of the Tents. the line of <strong><span class="military">Artillery Horse &amp; Infantry </span></strong>appeared in the most perfect order, the greatest silence was observed. <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Washington</span></strong> approached the right uncovered, passed along the line bowing in the most respectful
                     &amp; affectionate manner to the officers—he appeared pleased”</span></strong> (WELLFORD, 9–10).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"><strong><span class="persName">David Espy</span></strong> was one of <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>’s first settlers. His house was <strong><span class="quote">“a two-story stone structure with three windows across the front and a high hipped
                     roof giving almost a full floor in the attic.”</span></strong> The house had been used by <strong><span class="persName">Arthur St. Clair</span></strong> when he was prothonotary of <strong><span class="city">Bedford County</span></strong> (MULKEARN AND PUGH, 130, 139). road: For GW’s route to join Gen. John Forbes for
               the march on Fort Duquesne in 1758, see FREEMAN, 2:324–33.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>[195]</p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">20th</span></strong>. Called the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Quarter Master General</span></strong>, <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Adjutant General</span></strong>, Contractor, &amp; others of the Staff departmt. before me, &amp; the <strong><span class="USpolitical">Commander in chief</span></strong>, at 9 Oclock this morning, in order to fix on the Routs of the two Columns &amp; their
         Stages; and to know what the situation of matters were in their respective departments—and
         when they wd. be able to put the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> in motion. Also to obtain a correct return of the strength—and to press the <strong><span class="military">commanding Officers of Corps</span></strong> to prepare with all the Celerity in their power for a forward movement.
      </p>
      
      <p> Upon comparing accts., it was found that the <strong><span class="military">army</span></strong> could be put in motion 23d.—and it was so ordered, by the Routs which will be mentioned
         hereafter.
      </p>
      
      <p> Matters being thus arranged I wrote a farewell address to the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> through the <strong><span class="USpolitical">Commander in Chief</span></strong>—<strong><span class="persName">Govr. Lee</span></strong>—to be published in orders—and having prepared his Instructions and made every arrangement
         that occurred, as necessary I prepared for my return to <strong><span class="city">Philadelphia</span></strong> in order to meet <strong><span class="political">Congress</span></strong>, and to attend to the Civil duties of my Office.
      </p>
      
      <p> I should have mentioned before that I found (on my arrival at <strong><span class="city">Bedford</span></strong>) the judge, and <strong><span class="UScourt">Attorney</span></strong> for the district of <strong><span class="state">Pennsylvania</span></strong> attending, as they had been required to do, the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>I found also, which appeared to me to be an unlucky measure—that the former had issued
         his warrants against, and a party of light horse had actually siez’d, one Harman Husband
         &amp; one Filson as <strong><span class="military">Insurgents</span></strong> or abetters of the <strong><span class="military">Insurrection</span></strong>. I call it unlucky because my intention was to have suspended all proceedings of
         a Civil Nature until the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> had united its columns in the Center of the <strong><span class="military">Insurgent Counties</span></strong> &amp; then to have ciezed at one &amp; the same all the leaders and principals of the <strong><span class="military">Insurrection</span></strong> and because it is to be feared that the proceeding above mentioned will have given
         the alarm and those who are most obnoxious to punishment will flee from the Country.
