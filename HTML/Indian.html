      <p>Brothers of Passamaquodia	<strong><span class="placeName">Bucks County, Pa</span></strong>., <strong><span class="date">24 December 1776</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>I am glad to hear by <strong><span class="persName">Major Shaw</span></strong>, that You Accepted of the Chain of Freindship which I sent you last <strong><span>February</span></strong> from <strong><span class="placeName">Cambridge</span></strong>, &amp; that you are determined to keep it bright and unbroken.1
      </p>
      
      <p> When I first heard that you refused to send any of your Warriours to my Assistance
         when called upon by our Brothers of <strong><span class="persName">St Johns</span></strong> I did not know what to think; I was Afraid that some Enemy had turned your Hearts
         Against Me. But I am since informed that all your young Men were employed in Hunting,
         which was the reason of their not coming; This has Made my Mind easy, and I hope you
         will allways in future join with your Brothers of <strong><span class="persName">St Johns &amp; Penobscott</span></strong> when required.
      </p>
      
      <p>I have desired My Brother the Governr of <strong><span class="placeName">Massachusetts Bay</span></strong> to pay you the Money which <strong><span class="persName">Capt. Smith</span></strong> promised you for Sending My Letters to the Micmack Indians.2
      </p>
      
      <p> Brothers—I have a peice of News to tell you which I hope you will Attend to.
         Our Enemy the King of <strong><span class="placeName">Great Britain</span></strong> endeavoured to Stir up all the Indians from <strong><span class="placeName">Canada </span></strong>to <strong><span class="placeName">South Carolina</span></strong> Against Us, But our Bretheren of the Six Nations and their Allies the Shawanese and
         Delewares would not hearken to the Advice of the Messengers sent among them but kept
         fast hold of our Ancient Covenant Chain; The Cherokees and the Southern Tribes were
         foolish enough to listen to them, and to take up the Hatchet Against us, Upon this
         our Warriours went into their [434] Country, burnt their Houses, destroyed their Corn,
         and Oblidged them to sue for peace and give Hostages for their future Good Behaviour.
      </p>
      
      <p> Now Brothers never lett the Kings Wicked Councellors turn your Hearts Against Me
         and your Bretheren of this Country, but bear in Mind what I told you last February
         and what I tell you now. In token of my Freindship I send you this from my Army on
         the Banks of the great <strong><span class="placeName">River Delaware</span></strong> this <strong><span class="date">24th Day of December 1776</span></strong>.
      </p>
