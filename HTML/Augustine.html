      <p><strong><span class="settlement">Mount Vernon,</span></strong> <strong><span class="date">August 2, 1755.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> Dear Brother: The pleasure of your Company at <strong><span class="settlement">Mount Vernon</span></strong> always did, and always will, afford
         me infinite satisfaction; but at this time, I am too truly sensible how needful the
         Country is of the
         assistance of all its members, to desire to hear that any are absent. I most sincerely
         wish that
         harmony and unanimity may prevail amongst you, and that a happy issue may attend your
         prudent
         resolutions.
      </p>
      
      <p> I am not able were I ever so willing, to meet you in Town, for I assure you it is
         with some difficulty
         and with fatigue that I visit my Plantation's in the Neck, so much has a sickness
         of five weeks'
         continuance reduced me: But tho it is not in my power to meet you there, I can nevertheless
         assure you, and other's (who it may concern to borrow a phrase from 
         <strong><span class="persName">Governor Innes</span></strong>) that I am so little dispirited at what has happen'd, that I am always ready and
         always willing, to do my
         Country any Services that I am capable off; but never upon the Terms I have done,
         having suffer'd
         much in my private fortune, besides impairing one of the best of Constitution's. I
         was employ'd to go a journey in the Winter (when I believe few or none wou'd have
         
         undertaken it) and what did I get by it? my expenses borne! 
      </p>
      
      <p> I then was appointed with trifling Pay to conduct
         an handful of Men to the Ohio. What did I get by this? Why, after putting myself to
         a considerable
         expence in equipping and providing necessarys for the Campaigne I went out, was soundly
         beaten,
         lost them allâ€”came in, and had my Commission taken from me or, in other words my Corn'd,
         reduced, under pretence of an Order from home. I then went out a Volunteer with <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Braddock</span></strong>
         and lost all my Horses and many other things, but this being a voluntary act, I shou'd
         not have
         mention'd it, was it not to shew that I have been upon the loosing order ever since
         I enter'd the
         Service, which is now near two year's; so that I think I can't be blare'd, shou'd
         I, if I leave my Family
         again, end'vt. to do it upon such terms as to prevent my sufferg., (to gain by it,
         is the least of my ex-
         pectation).
      </p>
      
      <p>I doubt not but you have heard the particulars of our shameful defeat, which really
         was so
         scandalous that I hate to have it mention'd. You desire to know what Artillery was
         taken in the late
         Engt; it is easily told, we lost all that we carr'd out, save 2 Six pound'rs, and
         a few Cohorns that were
         left with <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Dunbar;</span></strong> and the Cohorns have since been destroy'd to expedate his flight. You also
         ask whether I think the Forces can March this Fall. I must answer, I think it impossible,
         for them to
         do the French any damage (unless it be by starv'g) for want of a proper Train of Artillery; yet
         they
         may be very serviceable in erect'g small Fortresses at convenient places to deposit
         provisions in, by
         which the Country will be eas'd of an immense expence in the Carriage, and it will
         also be a mean's
         of securing a Retreat if we sh'd be put to the Rout again; the success of this tho'
         will dep'd gre'tly
         upon what <strong><span class="persName">Gov'r. Shirley </span></strong>does at <strong><span class="placeName">Niagara,</span></strong> for if he succeeds, their Comn. with Canada will be entirely
         stop'd.
      </p>
      
      <p> It is impossible for me to guess at the number of recruits that may be want'g, as
         that must depend
         altogeth'r upon the strength of the French on the Ohio, w'ch to my g't. astonishm't we were ever
         strangers to.
      </p>
      
      <p>I thank you very heartily for your kind offer of a Chr. and for your goodness in sending
         my things;
         and, after begg'g you excuse the imperfect'ns. of the above which in part are owing
         to hav'g much
         Comp'y that hurrys me I shall conclude Dr. Sir, 
      </p>
      
      <p>Yr. most Afft. Broth'r.</p>
