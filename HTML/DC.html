      <p> <strong><span class="city">Philadelphia,</span></strong> <strong><span class="date">August 20, 1793.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>Gentlemen: This will be handed to you by <strong><span class="persName">Mr. James Greenleaf,</span></strong> a native of <strong><span class="city">Boston,</span></strong> who has resided
         for some years past in <strong><span class="city">Amsterdam</span></strong>, and has lately been appointed Consul for the <strong><span class="nation">U. S.</span></strong> at that place.
         This Gentleman, I understand, has it in contemplation to make certain proposals to you for building a number of houses in the <strong><span class="city">Federal City,</span></strong> provided he can have lots upon such terms and conditions as may correspond with his interest in the undertaking while it tends, at the same time, to promote the great object of the city. I am pursuaded, Gentlemen, that you will listen with attention and weigh with candour any proposals that may promise to promote the growth of the City in the degree that <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Greenleaf's</span></strong> undertaking upon the extensive Scale that it has been represented to me, would do. But it will lay with yourselves to decide how far the state of your funds will justify you closing with any proposals that may not tend to give them an immediate increase.
      </p>
      
      <p>It will undoubtedly be essential to <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Greenleaf</span></strong> that you should be impressed with just ideas
         with regard to his means of insuring the punctual performance of any engagements he
         may enter
         into, with you (if you shd. come upon any terms with him), and he will therefore undoubtedly
         take
         measures to satisfy you on this head. He has been represented to me as a Gentleman
         of large property and having the command of much money in this Country and in 
         <strong><span class="nation">Europe</span></strong>; but I can say nothing on this head from my own knowledge. Having had occasion to
         make enquiry respecting him
         before his appointment to the office of Consul, the Accounts which I received were
         highly favourable
         to <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Greenleaf,</span></strong> both as to the respectability of his connections in this Country and in <strong><span class="nation">Holland</span></strong>
         (where he married), and as to his own character. And I have reason to believe that
         if you can find
         it consistent with your duty to the public to attach <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Greenleaf</span></strong>to the <strong><span class="city">Federal City,</span></strong> he will be a
         valuable acquisition. I am Yours
