      <p><strong><span class="date"> May 1781</span></strong></p>
      
      
      <p>I begin, at this Epoch, a concise Journal of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military</span></strong> transactions &amp;ca;. I lament not having attempted it from the commencement of the
         War, in aid of my memory and wish the multiplicity of matter which continually surround
         me and the embarrassed State of our affairs which is momently calling the attention
         to perplexities of one kind or another, may not defeat altogether or so interrupt
         my present intention, &amp; plan, as to render it of little avail.
      </p>
      
      <p>To have the clearer understanding of the entries which may follow, it would be proper
         to recite, in detail, our wants and our prospects but this alone would be a Work of
         much time, and great magnitude. It may suffice to give the sum of them—wch., I shall
         do in a few words—viz.—
      </p>
      
      <p>Instead of having Magazines filled with provisions, we have a scanty pittance scattered
         here &amp; there in the different States. Instead of having our Arsenals well supplied
         with <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military</span></strong> Stores, they are poorly provided, &amp; the Workmen all leaving them. Instead of having
         the various articles of Field equipage in readiness to deliver, the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Quarter Master General</span></strong> (as the denier resort, according to his acct.) is but now applying to the several
         States to provide these things for their <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> respectively. Instead of having a regular System of transportation established upon
         credit or funds in the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Qr. Masters</span></strong> hands to defray the contingent Expences of it, we have neither the one nor the other
         and all that business, or a great part of it, being done by <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military</span></strong> Impress, we are daily &amp; hourly oppressing the people—souring their tempers and alienating
         their affection. Instead of having the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Regiments</span></strong> compleated to the New establishment (and which ought to have been So by the [   
         ] of [      ] agreeably to the requisitions of <strong><span class="political">Congress</span></strong>, scarce any State in the <strong><span class="political">Union</span></strong> has, at this hour, an eighth part of its quota in the field and little prospect,
         that I can see, of ever getting more than half. In a word—instead of having everything
         in readiness to take the Field, we have nothing—and instead of having the prospect
         of a glorious offensive campaign before us, we have a bewildered, and gloomy defensive
         one—unless we should receive a powerful aid of Ships—Land Troops and [357] Money from
         our generous allies &amp; these, at present, are too contingent to build upon.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">May 1st</span></strong>. Induced by pressing necessity—the inefficacy, &amp; bad tendency of pushing <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military</span></strong> Impresses too far and the impracticability of keeping the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> supplied without it, or money, to pay the transportation I drew for 9000 dollars
         of the Sum sent on by the State of <strong><span class="state">Massachusetts</span></strong> for payment of their <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong>; and placed it in the hands of the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">QM General</span></strong> with the most positive orders to apply it solely to this purpose.
      </p>
      
      <p>Fixed with <strong><span class="persName">Ezekiel Cornell Esqr.</span></strong> a member of the <strong><span class="political">Board of War</span></strong> (then on a tour to the Eastward to inspect some of the Armoury’s &amp;ca;.) on certain
         articles of Cloathing—arms and <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military</span></strong> Stores which might be sent from hence to supply the wants of the Southern Army.
         <strong><span class="persName">Major Talmadge</span></strong> was requested to press the C——s Senr. &amp; Junr. to continue their correspondence and
         was authorized to assure the elder C—— that he should be repaid the Sum of 100 Guineas,
         or more, with interest; provided he advanced the same for the purpose of defraying
         the expence of the correspondence, as he had offered to do.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="persName">Colo. Dayton</span></strong> was also written to, and pressed to establish a correspondence with <strong><span class="placeName">New York</span></strong>, by way of <strong><span class="city">Elizabeth Town</span></strong> for the purpose of obtaining intelligence of the <strong><span class="Britain">Enemys</span></strong> movemts. and designs; that by a comparison of Accts. proper &amp; just conclusions may
         be drawn.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">May 2d.</span></strong> No occurrence of note. A very fresh and steady gale of Wind all day from the So.
         East. Upon its shifting (about dusk) it blew violently, &amp; continued boisterous through
         the Night or greatest part of it.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">4th.</span></strong> A Letter of the <strong><span class="persName">Baron de Steuben</span></strong>’s from <strong><span class="placeName">Chesterfield Court House Virga.</span></strong> dated the <strong><span class="date">21st.</span></strong> Ulto. informs that 12 of the <strong><span class="Britain">Enemys</span></strong>Vessels but with what <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops </span></strong>he knew not, had advanced up James River as high as <strong><span class="city">Jamestown</span></strong>—that few <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong> were in arms and few arms to put into their hands—that he had moved the public Stores
         from <strong><span class="city">Richmond</span></strong> &amp;ca;. into the interior Country.
      </p>
      
      <p> A Letter from the <strong><span class="persName">Marqs. de la Fayette</span></strong>, dated at <strong><span class="city">Alexandria</span></strong> on the <strong><span class="date">23d</span></strong>., mentioned his having commenced his march that day for <strong><span class="city">Fredericksburg</span></strong>—that desertion had ceased, &amp; that his detachment were in good Spirits.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">5th.</span></strong> Accounts from <strong><span class="persName">Brigadr. Genl. Clinton</span></strong> at <strong><span class="city">Albany</span></strong>, dated the <strong><span class="date">30th.</span></strong> ulto. &amp; 1st. Inst., filled me with anxious fears that the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Garrison</span></strong> of <strong><span class="placeName">fort Schuyler</span></strong> would be obliged to evacuate the Post for want of Provisions and that a Mutiny in
         the other <strong><span class="USmilitary">Troops</span></strong> was to be apprehended. In consequence of this alarming information, I directed the
         <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Q. M. Gl.</span></strong> to send 50 Barls. of flour &amp; the like qty. of Salted Meat immy. up for the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Garrison</span></strong> of <strong><span class="placeName">Fort Schuyler</span></strong>—but of the latter there being only 24 in Store, no more could be sent.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">6th.</span></strong> <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Menonville,</span></strong> one of the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Adjutt. Generals</span></strong> in the <strong><span class="military">French Army</span></strong> came to Head Quarters by order of <strong><span class="persName">Count de Rochambeau </span></strong>to make arrangements for supplying the <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> of <strong><span class="persName">His Most Christian Majesty</span></strong> with certain provisions contracted for by <strong><span class="persName">Doctr. Franklin</span></strong>. This demand, tho’ the immediate compliance with it, was not insisted upon, comports
         illy with our circumstances; &amp; is exceedingly embarrassing.
      </p>
      
      <p>The <strong><span class="MilOfficer">D[eputy] Q[uarter] M[aster]</span></strong> at <strong><span class="placeName">Sussex C[our]t House</span></strong>, [360] conceiving that the Provision Magazine, &amp; other stores at that place were
         exposed to a surprize, and in danger of being destroyed by the <strong><span class="NativeTribe">Indians</span></strong> &amp; Tories who were infesting the Settlement at Minisink, I directed<strong><span class="persName"> Colo. Dayton</span></strong> to send a guard there from the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Jersey Brigade</span></strong> near <strong><span class="city">Morristown</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="persName">Mr. John Flood </span></strong>(at present a liver at lower Salem) whom I had sent for to obtain from him an acct.
         of the Harbours in the Sound from Frogs point Eastward, arrived; and gave the information
         wch. is filed in my Office.
      </p>
      
      <p> Other letters arriving this Evening late (more expressive of the wants of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">York Troops</span></strong> at <strong><span class="city">Albany</span></strong>, &amp; the Posts above) I ordered 100, out of 131 Barrls. of Flour which were in Store,
         to be immediately sent up; &amp; again called upon the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Q. M. Genl.</span></strong> in the most pointed terms to send active men to forward on, by every means they could
         devise, the Salted provs. in <strong><span class="city">Connecticut;</span></strong> &amp; flour from Sussex Ct. Ho. &amp;ca;.
      </p>
      
      <p> That the States might not only know our Wants, which my repeated &amp; pressing letters
         had recently, &amp; often communicated, but, if possible, be impressed with them and adopt
         some mode of Transporting it to the Army, I resolved to send <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Heath </span></strong>(2d. Offr. in Commd.) to make to the respective legislatures East of York State, pointed
         representations; &amp; to declare explicitly that unless measures are adopted to supply
         transportation, it will be impossible to subsist &amp; keep the <strong><span class="military">Troops </span></strong>together.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date"> 7th.</span></strong> The Wind which blew with great force from the So. East the last two days was accompanied
         this day by incessant Rain and was a most violent Storm &amp; is supposed to have done
         damage to Ships on the Coast.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">9th.</span></strong> Went to the Posts at <strong><span class="placeName">West point</span></strong>, and found by enquiry of <strong><span class="persName">General Heath</span></strong>, that all the Meat deposited in the advanced redoubts for contingent purposes would
         not, if served out, serve the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> two days—that the <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> had drawn none that day &amp; that none remained in the common Magazine.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">10th.</span></strong> The <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Q. M. Genl.</span></strong> representing, that it was not in his power to get the Salt Meat of <strong><span class="city">Connecticut</span></strong> transported—even for the Money that was put into his hands for this purpose—the people
         now alledging that they had no forage—when the badness of the roads was an excuse
         when they were called upon by the Executive of their State in the Month of March and
         that nothing but <strong><span class="military">Military</span></strong> force could affect the transport for our present wants. Parties were ordered out
         accordingly and the Officers commanding them directed to receive their Instructions
         from him.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>[362]<strong><span class="date">11th.</span></strong> <strong><span class="persName">Major Genl. Heath</span></strong> set out this day for the Eastn. States, provided with Instructions, and letters couched
         in strong terms—representing the distresses of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong> for want of provisions and the indispensable necessity of keeping up regular supplies
         by the adoption of a plan, which will have system &amp; permanency in’t.
      </p>
      
      <p>This day also I received advice from <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Dayton</span></strong> that 10 Ships of the line, and 3 or 4000 <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> had sailed from <strong><span class="city">New York</span></strong>. The intelligence was immediately communicated to Congress, and to the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">French Genl.</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Admiral</span></strong> at <strong><span class="state">R. Isld</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">12th.</span></strong> <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Dayton</span></strong>’s intelligence, so far as respected the Sailing of <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong>, was confirmed by two sensible deserters from <strong><span class="city">Kingsbridge</span></strong>; which place they left yesterday Morning at two Oclock. They add the detachment consisted
         of the <strong><span class="military">Grenadrs.</span></strong> (Bh.)—the <strong><span class="military">Corps. of Anspach</span></strong> (two Battalions) &amp; <strong><span class="military">the 37th. &amp; 43d. British regiments</span></strong>, amounting, as is supposed, to about 2000 Men under the Command of <strong><span class="persName">Majr. Genl. Redeisel</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">13th.</span></strong> Received Letters from <strong><span class="persName">Count de Rochambeau</span></strong> advising me of the arrival of his Son &amp; from <strong><span class="persName">Count de Barras</span></strong> informing me of his appointment to the Command of the <strong><span class="military">French Squadron</span></strong> at <strong><span class="state">Rhode Island</span></strong>—both solliciting an Interview with me as soon as possible. Appointed, in answer,
         <strong><span class="date">Monday the 21st</span></strong>. Inst. &amp; Wethersfield, as the time &amp; place of Meeting.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">14th.</span></strong> About Noon, intelligence was recd. from <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Patterson</span></strong> at<strong><span class="placeName"> West point</span></strong>, that the <strong><span class="Britain">Enemy</span></strong> were on the No. side of Croton in force—that <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Green</span></strong>,<strong><span class="persName"> Majr. Flag</span></strong>, &amp; some other officers with 40 or 50 Men were surprized &amp; cut off at the Bri⟨dg⟩e
         &amp; that <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Scammell</span></strong> with the <strong><span class="USmilitary">New Hampshire Troops</span></strong> had Marched to their assistance. I ordered the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Connecticut Troops </span></strong>to move in &amp; support those of <strong><span class="state">New Hampshire</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> In the evening, information was brot. that the <strong><span class="Britain">enemy</span></strong> (consisting of about 60 horse, &amp; 140 Infantry) had retreated precipitately &amp; that
         several of our <strong><span class="USmilitary">Soldiers</span></strong> had been inhumanly murdered.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>[365]<strong><span class="date">15th.</span></strong> Information, dated 12 oclock yesterday reports 15 Sail of Vessels &amp; a number of Flatboats
         to be off <strong><span class="placeName">Fort Lee</span></strong>. Ordered a detachment of 200 Men to March immediately to support the Post at Dobbs’s.
         ferry—countenance the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong>, &amp; cover the Country in that Neighbourhood.
      </p>
      
      <p> Intelligence from C—— Senr., dated 729—a detachment is expected to Sail tomorrow
         from <strong><span class="city">New York</span></strong>, &amp; said to consist of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Anspach Troops’s 43d. B. Regiment</span></strong>, remainder of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">76th., 80th., 17th. Dragoons, &amp; Infantry</span></strong> of the same—to be conveyed by 7 Ships of the line, 2 fifties, &amp; 3 forty fours which
         are to cruize of the Capes of <strong><span class="state">Virginia</span></strong>. He gives it as the opinion of C—— Junr. that the above detachmt. does not exceed
         2000 Men—that not more than 4000 remain—wch. is only (he adds) to be accounted for
         on the supposition of their expecting a reinforcement immediately from <strong><span class="nation">Europe</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">16th.</span></strong> Went to the Posts at <strong><span class="placeName">West point</span></strong>. Received a particular acct. of the surprize of <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Green</span></strong> &amp; the loss we sustained which consisted of himself &amp; <strong><span class="persName">Major (Flag)</span></strong> killed—three officers &amp; a Surgeon taken prisoners (the latter &amp; two of the former
         wounded)—a <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Sergeant</span></strong> &amp; 5 R[ank] &amp; F[ile] killed—5 left wounded &amp; 33 made Prisoners &amp; missing—in all 44
         besides Officers.
      </p>
      
      <p>The report of the number of Shipping &amp;ca;. at <strong><span class="placeName">Fort Lee</span></strong> was this day contradicted in part—the number of Vessels being reduced, &amp; said to
         be no higher than Bulls ferry. In consequence of this intelligence <strong><span class="persName">Lt. Colo. Badlam</span></strong> who marched with the detachment of 200 Men pursuant to the order of Yesterday &amp; had
         reached Stony point halted—but was directed not to return till the designs of the
         enemy were better understood.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date"> 17th.</span></strong> Received a letter from <strong><span class="persName">Captn. Lawrence</span></strong>, near <strong><span class="city">Dobbss ferry</span></strong>, informing me that abt. 200 Refugees were building a block house &amp; raising other
         works at <strong><span class="placeName">Fort Lee</span></strong>. Order’d the detachment [366] [367] which had halted at <strong><span class="city">Kings Ferry</span></strong> &amp; another forming under <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Scammel</span></strong> to advance down &amp; endeavour to annoy, if they could not prevent them.
      </p>
      
      <p> A Letter from <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Foreman</span></strong> of Monmouth (dated the 14th. Instt.) informs me that the <strong><span class="Britain">British fleet</span></strong> from <strong><span class="city">New York</span></strong> consisting of Seven Ships of 60 Guns &amp; upwards—12 large Transport Vessels, &amp; 10 topsail
         Schooners &amp; Sloops made Sail from Sandy hook the 12th., with the wind at So. East.
         but veering round to the Southward, &amp; Westward, it returned within the hook &amp; lay
         there till 10 o’clock next day when it again Sailed. By two oclock it was clear of
         the hook and steering Southward.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">18th.</span></strong> Received Letters from Generals <strong><span class="persName">Schuyler</span></strong> and <strong><span class="persName">Clinton</span></strong> giving an acct. of the threatened Invasion of the Northern Frontier of this State
         from <strong><span class="nation">Canada</span></strong>, and of the unfavourable prospects from Vermont and of the destruction of the Post
         of <strong><span class="placeName">Fort Schuyler</span></strong>—the indefensible State of the Works occasioned thereby &amp; submitting for considn.
         the propriety of removing the <strong><span class="military">Garrison</span></strong> to the <strong><span class="military">German Flatts</span></strong> which he (that is Clinton) was requested to do if it appear’d to be the sense of
         the <strong><span class="USpolitical">Governor</span></strong> &amp; other principal Gentn. of the State that it would be eligable.
      </p>
      
      <p>Set out this day for the Interview at <strong><span class="city">Weathersfield</span></strong> with the <strong><span class="persName">Count de Rochambeau</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="persName">Admiral Barras</span></strong>. Reached <strong><span class="placeName">Morgans Tavern</span></strong> 43 Miles from <strong><span class="city">Fishkill Landing</span></strong> after dining at <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Vandebergs</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="date">19th</span></strong>. Breakfasted at Litchfield—dined at Farmington &amp; lodged at <strong><span class="city">Weathersfield </span></strong>at the House of <strong><span class="persName">Joseph Webb Esqr.</span></strong> (the Quarters wch. were taken for me &amp; my Suit).
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">20th.</span></strong> Had a good deal of private conversation with <strong><span class="persName">Govr. Trumbull</span></strong> who gave it to me as his opinion that if any important offensive operation should
         be undertaken he had little doubt of our obtaining Men &amp; Provision adequate to our
         wants. In this opinion <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Wadsworth</span></strong> &amp; others concurr’d.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>[369]<strong><span class="date">21st.</span></strong> The <strong><span class="persName">Count de Rochambeau</span></strong> with the <strong><span class="persName">Chevr. de Chastellux</span></strong> arrived about Noon. The appearance of the <strong><span class="Britain">British Fleet</span></strong> (under <strong><span class="persName">Adml.

      <p><strong><span class="date"> 22nd.</span></strong> Fixed with <strong><span class="persName">Count de Rochambeau</span></strong> upon a plan of Campaign—in Substance as follows. That the <strong><span class="military">French Land force</span></strong> (except 200 Men) should March so soon as the <strong><span class="military">Squadron</span></strong> could Sail for <strong><span class="city">Boston</span></strong>—to the North River &amp; there, in conjunction with the American, to commence an operation
         against <strong><span class="city">New York</span></strong> (which in the present reduced State of the <strong><span class="military">Garrison</span></strong> it was thought would fall, unless relieved; the doing which wd. enfeeble their Southern
         operations, and in either case be productive of capital advantages) or to extend our
         views to the Southward as circumstances and a Naval superiority might render more
         necessary &amp; eligable. The aid which would be given to such an operation in this quarter—the
         tardiness with which the Regiments would be filled for any other—the insurmountable
         difficulty &amp; expence of Land transportation—the waste of Men in long marches (especially
         where there is a disinclination to the Service—objections [370] to the climate &amp;ca;.)
         with other reasons too numerous to detail, induced to this opinion. The heavy Stores
         &amp; Baggage of the <strong><span class="military">French Army</span></strong> were to be deposited at <strong><span class="city">Providence</span></strong> under Guard of 200 Men (before mentioned) &amp; <strong><span class="placeName">Newport Harbour</span></strong> &amp; Works were to be secured by 500 <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong>.

      <p>  <strong><span class="date">23d.</span></strong> <strong><span class="persName">Count de Rochambeau</span></strong> set out on his Return to <strong><span class="city">Newport</span></strong>, while I prepared and forwarded dispatches to the <strong><span class="USpolitical">Governors</span></strong> of the four <strong><span class="state">New England</span></strong> States calling upon them in earnest &amp; pointed terms, to compleat their <strong><span class="USmilitary">Continental Battalions</span></strong> for the Campaign, at least, if it could not be done for the War or 3 Years—to hold
         a body of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong> (according to the Proportion given them) ready to march in one Week after being called
         for and to adopt some effectual mode to supply the <strong><span class="military">Troops</span></strong> when assembled with Provisns. &amp; Transportation.
      </p>
      
      <p> I also sollicited the <strong><span class="USpolitical">Governors</span></strong> of the States of <strong><span class="city">Massachusetts</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="city">Connecticut</span></strong>earnestly for a Loan of Powder &amp; the means of Transporting it to the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Army</span></strong>.

      <p>[371] A Letter from <strong><span class="persName">Genl. St. Clair</span></strong> came to hand with accts. of an apparent intention of the <strong><span class="Britain">enemy</span></strong> to evacuate <strong><span class="state">New York</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">24th.</span></strong> Set out on my return to <strong><span class="city">New Windsor</span></strong>—dined at <strong><span class="city">Farmington </span></strong>and lodged at <strong><span class="city">Litchfield</span></strong>.

      <p> <strong><span class="date">25th.</span></strong> Breakfasted at Squire Cogswells—dined at <strong><span class="persName">Colo.

Schuyler</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="persName">Clinton</span></strong>, full of uncertain information respecting the enemys landing at Crown point &amp; intention
         to penetrate on the Hudson &amp; Mohawk Rivers. This uncertainty respects the number,
         not the fact—the latter seeming to be beyond a doubt. In consequence of this information
         I ordered the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Companies of Vanscaicks Regiment</span></strong> at <strong><span class="placeName">West point</span></strong> to hold themselves in readiness to Move at an hours warning.

         Country—to be applied in part to the purchase of Arms—Cloaths &amp;ca;. for the <strong><span class="USmilitary">American Troops</span></strong> and the [372] ballance to my orders, &amp; draughts at long sight and that a Fleet of
         20 Sail of the Line was on its departure for the <strong><span class="placeName">West Indies</span></strong> 12 of which were to proceed to this Coast where it was probable they might arrive
         in the <strong><span class="date">Month of July.</span></strong> He also added that the <strong><span class="political">Courts of Petersbg</span></strong>. &amp; Vienna had offered their Mediation in settling the present troubles wch. the <strong><span class="persName">King of France</span></strong>, tho’ personally pleas’d with, could not accept without consulting his Allies.

      <p> <strong><span class="date">28th.</span></strong> The <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Commanding Officer of Artillery</span></strong> &amp; the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">chief Engineer</span></strong> were called upon to give in estimates of their wants for the intended operation against
         <strong><span class="state">New York</span></strong>. The intention of doing this was also disclosed to the <strong><span class="MilOfficer">Q. M. General</span></strong> who was desired to give every attention toward the Boats, that a number of them might
         be prepared; &amp; provide other matters necessary to such an undertaking—especially those
         things which might be called for by the Artillery, &amp; the Engineering departments.

      <p><strong><span class="date">31st.</span></strong> A Letter from <strong><span class="persName">Count de Rochambeau</span></strong> informed me that the <strong><span class="Britain">British fleet</span></strong> had left Block Island—that <strong><span class="persName">Adml. de Barras</span></strong> would Sail with the first fair Wind for <strong><span class="city">Boston</span></strong> (having 900 of his Soldiers on Board to Man his fleet) and that he should commence
         his March as soon as possible, but would be under the necessity of Halting a few days
         at <strong><span class="city">Providence</span></strong>.

      <p> A Letter from <strong><span class="persName">Major Talmage</span></strong>, inclosing one from C—— Senr. &amp; another from S.

         they could not assign. Neither C. Senr. nor S. G. estimate the <strong><span class="Britain">Enemys</span></strong> regular force at <strong><span class="city">New York</span></strong> or its dependencies at more than 4500 men including the New Levies; but C—— says
         it is reported that they can command five &amp; some add 6,000 Militia &amp; refugees. S.
