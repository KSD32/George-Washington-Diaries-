      <p><strong><span class="placeName">Camp at Will's Creek,</span></strong> <strong><span class="date">June 7, 1755.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p>Dear <strong><span class="persName">Jack</span></strong>: As much hurried as I am at present, I can't think of leaving this place without
         writing to
         you; tho' I have no time to be particular. I was Escorted by 8 Men of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong> from <strong><span class="settlement">Winchester</span></strong> to
         this place; which 8 Men were 2 Days assembling; but I believe they wou'd not have
         been more than
         as many seconds dispersing if I had been attacked. Upon arrival here, I found <strong><span class="persName">Sir Jno. St. Clair</span></strong>
         with a body of 500 Men were March'd to prepare the Roads, lay a deposit of Provisions
         at the little
         Meadows, and to erect some kind of defensive work there.
      </p>
      
      <p>To morrow <strong><span class="persName">Sir Peter</span></strong> with the first <strong><span class="military">Brigade</span></strong>, begin their March, and on Monday the General and the 2d. will follow. We have no
         certain acct. from 
         the Ohio: but have advices from <strong><span class="settlement">Philadelphia</span></strong> that a body of 300 F. pass'd Oswego on their way to <strong><span class="settlement">Fort Duquisne,</span></strong> and
         that a larger Detachment was hourly expected. A Captn. of <strong><span class="persName">Sir Peter's </span></strong>Regim't with several of the
         common Soldiers of the different Corps has died since our Incampm't here, and many
         others are
         now sick with a kind of bloody Flux. I wrote from <strong><span class="settlement">Winchester</span></strong> a Letter which I hope you have receiv'd
         and shou'd be glad of an answer as soon as possible; any Letter's to me, directed
         to the care of <strong><span class="persName">Mr.
               Cox,</span></strong> at <strong><span class="settlement">Winchester,</span></strong> will be certain of a conveyance I am <strong><span class="persName">Dr. Jack</span></strong> Yr. most Affe. Brother
