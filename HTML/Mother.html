      <p><strong><span class="city">Winchester,</span></strong> <strong><span class="date"> May 6,1755</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> Honour'd Madam: I cam to this place last <strong><span class="date">Saturday</span></strong>, and shall set out to morrow with the General of <strong><span class="city">Wills Creek</span></strong>; where I fear we shall wait some time for a sufficient
         number of Waggons to transport us over the Mountains.
         I am very happy in the General's Family, and I am treated with a complaisant Freedom
         which is quite agreeable; so that I have no occasion to doubt the satisfaction I
         propos'd in making the Campaigne. As we have met with nothing yet worth relating I
         shall only beg my love to my Brother's and Sister's; and Compliments to Friends.
         I am , Honour'd Madam
         Your most dutiful and obedient son,
         
      </p>
