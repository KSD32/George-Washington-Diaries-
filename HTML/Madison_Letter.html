            <p> My dear Sir,</p>	
            
            <p><strong><span class="placeName">Mount Vernon</span></strong> Feby 5th 1788.
            </p>
            
            <p>I am indebted to you for several of your favors, and thank you for their enclosures.
                The rumours of War between <strong><span class="location">France</span></strong> and <strong><span class="location">England</span></strong> have subsided; and the poor <strong><span class="persName">Patriots</span></strong> of <strong><span class="location">Holland</span></strong>, it seems, are left to fight their own Battles or negotiate—in neither case with
                any great prospect of advantage—They must have been deceived, or their conduct has
                been divided, precip-[it]ant, &amp; weak—the former, with some blunders, have, I conceive,
                been the causes of their misfortunes.
            </p>
            
            <p> I am sorry to find by yours, and other accts from <strong><span class="location">Massachusetts</span></strong>, that the decision of its <strong><span class="orgName">Convention</span></strong> (at the time of their dates) remained problematical. A rejection of the New form
                by that State will envigorate the opposition, not only in <strong><span class="location">New York</span></strong>, but in all those which are to follow; at the sametime that it will afford materials
                for the Minority in such as have adopted it, to blow the Trumpet of discord more loudly.
                The acceptance by a bare majority, tho’ preferable to rejection, is also to be depricated.
            </p>
            
            <p> It is scarcely possible to form any decided opinion of the general sentiment of the
                people of this State, on this important subject. Many have asked me with anxious sollicitude,
                if you did not mean to get into the <strong><span class="orgName">Convention</span></strong>; conceiving it of indispensable necessity. <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Mason,</span></strong> who returned here only yesterday, has offered himself, I am told, for the County
                of Stafford; and his friends add, he can be elected not only there, but for <strong><span class="persName">Prince William </span></strong>&amp; Fauquier also.1 The truth of this I know not. I rarely go from home and my visitors
                who for the most part are travellers and strangers, have not the least information.
            </p>
            
            <p> At the time you suggested for my consideration, the expediency of a communication
                of my sentiments on the proposed <strong><span class="name">Constitution</span></strong>, to any corrispondent I might have in <strong><span class="location">Massachusetts</span></strong>, it did not occur to me that <strong><span class="persName">Genl Lincoln</span></strong> &amp; myself frequently interchanged letters—much less did I expect that a [90] hasty,
                and indigested extract of one which I had written—intermixed with a variety of other
                matter to <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Chas Carter</span></strong>, in answer to a letter I had received from him respecting Wolf dogs—Wolves—Sheep—experiments
                in Farming &amp;ca &amp;ca &amp;ca—was then in the press, and would bring these sentiments to
                public view by means of the extensive circulation I find that extract has had.2 Altho’
                I never have concealed, and am perfectly regardless who becomes acquainted with my
                sentiments on the proposed <strong><span class="name">Constitution</span></strong>, yet nevertheless, as no care had been taken to dress the ideas, nor any reasons
                assigned in support of my opinion, I felt myself hurt by the publication; and informed
                my friend the Colonel of it. In answer, he has fully exculpated himself from the intention,
                but his zeal in the cause prompted him to distribute copies, under a prohibition (which
                was disregarded) that they should not go to the press. As you have seen the rude,
                or crude extract (as you may please to term it) I will add no more on the subject.
            </p>
            
            <p> Perceiving that the <strong><span class="persName">Fœderalist</span></strong>, under the signature of <strong><span class="persName">Publius</span></strong>, is about to be republished, I would thank you for forwarding to me three or four
                Copies; one of which to be neatly bound, and inform me of the cost.3
                Altho’ we have not had many, or deep Snows since the commencement of them, yet we
                have had a very severe Winter; and if the cold of this day is proportionably keen
                with you, a warm room, &amp; a good fire will be found no bad, or uncomfortable antidote
                to it. With sentiments of perfect esteem and friendship I am—Dear Sir Yr Affecte &amp;
                Obedt Servt
            </p>
