      </p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Thomas Nelson</span></strong> <strong><span class="note">[11]</span></strong> joined my Family this day.
      </p>
      
      <p> Dispatched Many of the Comns. for the Judiciary Judges, Marshalls and Attorneys this
         day with the Acts <strong><span class="note">[12]</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 1. George Read (1733–1798) was United States senator from Delaware. A signer of the
               Declaration of Independence, Read was a member of the Continental Congress 1774–77
               and a delegate from Delaware to the Constitutional Convention where he represented
               the interests of the small states. He served in the Senate from 1789 to 1793 when
               he became chief justice of Delaware.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 2. Theodorick Bland had been elected to the House of Representatives from Virginia
               in 1789.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 3. James Madison had been elected to the House of Representatives from Virginia in
               1789 with GW’s quiet support. During the early months of his administration GW had
               frequently called upon Madison for advice on matters pertaining to appointments and
               protocol and requested his aid in drawing up such official papers as his first inaugural
               and other addresses and statements to Congress. In these months Madison assumed the
               role of an unofficial cabinet member and administration whip in the House (see BRANT,
               3:276–89).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 4. Samuel Osgood (1748–1813) had been a member of the Continental Congress [449]
               1781–84 and of the Board of Treasury 1785–89. Although he opposed ratification of
               the Constitution, GW appointed him postmaster general 26 Sept. 1789, a post he retained
               until the federal government moved to Philadelphia in 1790. In 1786 he married Maria
               Bowne Franklin, widow of Walter Franklin of New York. Upon GW’s arrival in New York
               he occupied a house facing Franklin Square built by Walter Franklin and now owned
               by Osgood. The house, “square, five windows wide, and three stories high,” had previously
               been occupied by the president of the Continental Congress (DECATUR, 117). Congress
               had ordered Osgood 15 April 1789 to “put the same, and the furniture therein, in proper
               condition for the residence and use of the President of the United States, to provide
               for his temporary accommodation” (Annals of Congress, 1st Cong., 1st sess., 149–50).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 5. William Duer (1747–1799) was born in Devonshire, Eng., educated at Eton, and served
               in India as aide-de-camp to Lord Clive. He emigrated to America in 1768 and settled
               in New York where he became active in business and politics. Duer was a member of
               the Continental Congress in 1777 and 1778 and in Mar. 1786 was appointed to the Board
               of Treasury. His appointment as assistant secretary of the treasury in 1789 was one
               of GW’s more controversial appointments since Duer’s speculative ventures had already
               excited the suspicions of the Antifederalists. In 1779 Duer married Catherine Alexander,
               usually called Lady Kitty, daughter of William Alexander, Lord Stirling.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 6. Anne Brown (Browne), who was born in 1754, was a daughter of William and Mary
               French Browne of Salem, Mass. (Some members of the family dropped the “e” from the
               family name.) Her parents died while she was still a child and she was sent to New
               York to live with relatives. In Dec. 1773 she and her older half-brother William Burnet
               Browne visited Mount Vernon (see entry for 11 Dec. 1773). In 1764 William Burnet Browne
               married Judith Walker Carter, daughter of Charles Carter of Cleve in King George County.
               Browne and his family lived at Elsing Green in King William County, Va. In the early
               1790s the Brownes’ daughter Judith Walker Browne married GW’s nephew Robert Lewis.
               Anne Brown (Browne) was a cousin of Lady Kitty Duer.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 7. Lewis Morris (1726–1798), a half brother of Gouverneur Morris, was born at the
               family estate, Morrisania, in Westchester County, N.Y., and educated at Yale. A signer
               of the Declaration of Independence, he served in the Continental Congress 1775–77
               and in the New York legislature 1777–81, and as a member of the New York Ratifying
               Convention he had vigorously supported the Constitution. In 1749 he married Mary Walton,
               daughter of Jacob and Maria Beekman Walton. At his father’s death in 1762 Morris had
               received the half of the estate of Morrisania lying west of Mill Brook, and in 1789
               he was still engaged in restoring his property which had been extensively damaged
               by the British during the Revolution.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 8. Lady Christina (Christiana) Griffin (1751–1807) was the wife of Cyrus Griffin
               (1748–1810), a prominent Virginia jurist and the last president of the Continental
               Congress. In 1770 Griffin had married Lady Christina (Christiana) Stuart, daughter
               of John Stuart, sixth earl of Traquair, in Edinburgh. In Aug. 1789 Griffin had been
               appointed a member of the commission to negotiate with the southern Indians (see entry
               for 16 Nov. 1789) and was now absent from New York. In Feb. 1790 GW appointed him
               federal judge of the district of Virginia.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 9. James Duane (1733–1797), of New York City, was a member of the Continental [450]
               Congress from 1774 to 1783 where he was particularly active in financial and Indian
               affairs. He was mayor of New York City from 1784 to 1789 and a member of the New York
               Ratifying Convention where he strongly supported the Constitution. In 1759 Duane had
               married Mary Livingston, daughter of Robert Livingston, third lord of Livingston Manor.
               GW appointed him first federal judge for the district of New York in Sept. 1789.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 10. Catharine Littlefield Greene (1755–1814), a native of Shoreham, R.I., had married
               Nathanael Greene in 1774. During the Revolution the Greenes became close friends of
               the Washingtons. Greene died in 1786, leaving a plantation in Georgia and a legacy
               of debt to his wife and five children. At [451] this time Mrs. Greene was spending
               part of her time in Newport, R.I., and part in New York City.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 11.Thomas Nelson, Jr., was the son of Gov. Thomas Nelson of Virginia. Governor Nelson
               had died in Jan. 1789 leaving his wife and children impoverished and with extensive
               debts. David Stuart wrote GW, 14 July 1789, suggesting that some government position
               might be found for young Thomas. Since the governor had been an “old friend and acquaintance,”
               GW decided to appoint the young man as one of his secretaries, although “I must confess
               there are few persons of whom I have no personal knowledge or good information that
               I would take into my family, where many qualifications are necessary to fit them for
               the duty of it—to wit, a good address, abilities above mediocrity—secresy and prudence—attention
               and industry—good temper—and a capacity and disposition to write correctly and well,
               and to do it obligingly” (GW to Stuart, 26 July 1789; GW to Nelson, 27 July 1789;
               Nelson to GW, 13 Aug. 1789, DLC:GW). Nelson resigned from GW’s family in Nov. 1790
               (Nelson to GW, 24 Nov. 1790, DLC:GW).</span></strong></p>

      <p>The Visitors to <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Washington</span></strong> <strong><span class="note">[13]</span></strong> this evening were not numerous.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 13. Martha Washington held her levees, lasting about three hours, on Friday evenings
               at 8:00, and GW usually attended. “She gives Tea, Coffee, Cake, Lemonade &amp; Ice Creams,”
               Abigail Adams noted. “The form of Reception is this, the servants announce &amp; Col.
               Humphries or Mr. Lear, receives every Lady at the door, &amp; Hands her up to Mrs. Washington
               to whom she makes a most Respectfull courtsey and then is seated without noticeing
               any of the rest of the company. The Pressident then comes up and speaks to the Lady,
               which he does with a grace dignity &amp; ease, that leaves Royal George far behind him.
               The company are entertaind with Ice creems &amp; Lemonade, and retire at their pleasure
               performing the same ceremony when they quit the Room.” Frequently the receptions were
               “as much crowded as a Birth Night at St. James, and with company as Briliantly drest,
               diamonds &amp; great Hoops excepted” (Abigail Adams to Mary Cranch, 9 Aug. 1789, 5 Jan.
               and 27 July 1790, MITCHELL, 18, 35, 55).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">Saturday 3d</span></strong>. Sat for Mr. Rammage <strong><span class="note">[14]</span></strong> near two hours to day, who was drawing a miniature Picture of me for <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Washington</span></strong>.
      </p>
      
      <p>Walked in the Afternoon, and sat about two Oclock for <strong><span class="persName">Madam de Brehan</span></strong> <strong><span class="note">[15]</span></strong> to complete a Miniature profile of me which she had begun from Memory and which she
         had made exceedingly like the Original.
      </p>
      
      <p>[452]</p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 14. John Rammage (1763–1802), a skilled miniature painter and silversmith, had been
               a lieutenant in the Royal Irish Volunteers in Boston in 1775 and subsequently served
               in the British army in Halifax and New York, where he settled after the Revolution.
               Rammage, an Irishman, was “a handsome man of the middle size,” a contemporary noted,
               who “dressed fashionably . . . a scarlet coat with mother-of-pearl buttons—a white
               silk waistcoat embroidered with colored flowers—black satin breeches and paste knee
               buckles . . . a gold-headed cane and gold snuff box, completed his costome” (DUNLAP,
               1:267–68). Rammage’s debts eventually forced him to flee to Canada where he remained
               until his death. The miniature Rammage was working on today was probably the Betty
               Washington—Stabler miniature, painted on ivory (see EISEN, 2:487).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 15. The marquise de Bréhan and the comte de Moustier, who had visited GW at Mount
               Vernon in 1788 (see entry for 2 Nov. 1788) now lived in the Macomb House on Broadway,
               soon to be occupied by GW. Both Moustier and his sister were widely unpopular in the
               United States. “We have a French minister now with us,” John Armstrong complained,
               “and if France had wished to destroy the little remembrance that is left of her and
               her exertions in our behalf, she would have sent just such a minister: distant, haughty,
               penurius, and entirely governed by the caprices of a little singular, whimsical, hysterical
               old woman, whose delight is in playing with a negro child, and caressing a monkey”
               (GRISWOLD, 93; see also John Jay to Jefferson, 25 Nov. 1788, JEFFERSON [1], 14:291).
               The marquise was a skilled miniaturist and had worked on a portrait of GW on her visit
               to Mount Vernon in 1788. She may have begun the work from one of Houdon’s busts in
               Paris, and continued it at her visit to Mount Vernon and at this sitting. “Her painting
               was in cameo-relief in blue, white, and black, and looks like carved reliefs, though
               painted profiles. She made a number of copies” (EISEN, 2:454–55, 591–92).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">Sunday 4th</span></strong>. Went to St. Pauls Chappel <strong><span class="note">[16]</span></strong> in the forenoon. Spent the remainder of the day in writing private letters for tomorrows
         Post.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 16. St. Paul’s Chapel, opened in 1766, was one of two Protestant Episcopal chapels
               which had been established when Trinity Church needed additional parish facilities
               (SMITH [4], 136). GW attended St. Paul’s regularly in 1789 and early 1790, probably
               because the rebuilding of Trinity, which had been destroyed by fire in 1776, was not
               yet completed. When the new building, erected on its original site at Broadway and
               Wall Street, was consecrated in Mar. 1790, it contained a pew for the president, and
               GW frequently attended Trinity for the remainder of his stay in New York.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">Monday 5th</span></strong>. Dispatched the Commissions to all the Judges of the Supreme and District Courts;

      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 23. Hamilton’s suggestion was undoubtedly a welcome one to GW. In addition to his
               own frequent and pleasant contacts with Morris after the Revolution, Morris’s abilities
               had been prominently displayed at the Constitutional Convention where he had led the
               fight for a strong and independent presidency. He was already in Europe, having arrived
               in Paris in early 1789 to attend to the problems arising out of business associate
               Robert Morris’s tobacco contract with the Farmers General and to engage in a highly
               speculative attempt to purchase the American debt to France. Since the mission to
               Britain was unofficial, the appointment would not have to run the gamut of the Senate
               where there was considerable suspicion of Morris’s political principles and personal
               morality. GW wrote Morris two letters 13 Oct. 1789 [1] [2] requesting that he undertake
               the unofficial mission to London to discuss with the British ministry the possibility
               of a commercial treaty between Great Britain and the United States and attempt to
               reach an understanding on the major grievances between the two countries: the failure
               of American citizens to pay debts owed to British creditors and the retention by the
               British government of seven frontier posts in American territory (WRITINGS, 30:439–42).
               On the same day the president sent Morris a personal request that he procure for him
               “mirrors for a table, with neat &amp; fashionable but not expensive ornaments for them;
               [456] such as will do credit to your taste” and “handsome &amp; useful Coolers for wine

         that if <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Gouvr. Morris</span></strong> was employed in this business it would be a commitment for his appointment as Minister
         if one should be sent to that Court or wanted at <strong><span class="city">Versailles</span></strong> in place of <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Jefferson</span></strong>—and Moreover if either of these was his Wish whether his representations might not

      <p> <strong><span class="date">Thursday 15th.</span></strong> Commenced my Journey about 9 oclock for <strong><span class="city">Boston</span></strong> and a tour through the Eastern States. The <strong><span class="roleName">Chief Justice</span></strong>, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Jay</span></strong> and the <strong><span class="roleName">Secretaries of the Treasury and War Departments</span></strong> accompanied me some distance out of the City. About 10 Oclock it began to Rain, and
         continued to do so till 11, when we arrived at [461] the house of one Hoyatt, who
         keeps a Tavern at Kings-bridge <strong><span class="note">[39]</span></strong> where we, that is <strong><span class="persName">Major Jackson</span></strong>, <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Lear</span></strong> and myself, with Six Servants which composed my Retinue, dined. After dinner through
         frequent light Showers we proceedd. to the Tavern of a <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Haviland</span></strong> at Rye; <strong><span class="note">[40]</span></strong> who keeps a very neat and decent Inn.
      </p>
      
      <p>The Road for the greater part, indeed the whole way, was very rough and Stoney, but
         the Land strong, well covered with grass and a luxurient Crop of Indian Corn intermixed
         with Pompions [pumpkins] (Which were yet ungathered) in the fields. We met four droves
         of Beef Cattle for the <strong><span class="state">New York</span></strong> Market (about 30 in a drove) some of which were very fine—also a flock of Sheep for
         the same place. We scarcely passed a farm house that did not abd. in Geese. Their
         Cattle seemed to be of a good quality and their hogs large but rather long legged.
         No dwelling Ho. is seen without a Stone or Brick Chimney and rarely any without a
         shingled roof—generally the Sides are of Shingles also. The distance of this days
         travel was 31 Miles in which we passed through (after leaving the Bridge) East Chester
         New Rochel &amp; Marmeroneck; but as these places (though they have houses of worship
         in them) are not regularly laid out, they are scarcely to be distinguished from the
         intermediate farms which are very close together and seperated, as one Inclosure from
         another also is, by fences of Stone which are indeed easily made, as the Country is
         immensely Stony. Upon enquiry we find their Crops of Wheat &amp; Rye have been abundant
         [462] —though of the first they had sown rather sparingly on Acct. of the destruction
         which had of late years been made of that grain by what is called the Hessian fly.
      </p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 39. Caleb Hyatt had purchased this inn from George Dyckman.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 40. Mrs. Haviland was Tamar Haviland, who kept an inn called the Square House at
               Rye in Westchester County. She was the widow of Dr. Ebenezer Haviland, who had served
               as surgeon to several New York regiments during the Revolution.</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="note">Friday 16th.</span></strong> About 7 Oclock we left the Widow Havilands, and after passing Horse Neck [Greenwich]
         Six Miles distant from Rye, the Road through which is hilly and immensely stoney and
         trying to Wheels &amp; Carriages,<strong><span class="note">[41]</span></strong> we breakfasted at Stamford which is 6 miles further (at one Webbs) <strong><span class="note">[42]</span></strong> a tolerable good house, but not equal in appearance or reality, to <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Havilds</span></strong>. In this Town are an Episcopal Church and a Meeting house. At <strong><span class="city">Norwalk</span></strong> which is ten miles further we made a halt to feed our Horses. To the lower end of
         this town Sea Vessels come and at the other end are Mills, Stores, and an <strong><span class="religious">Episcopal and Presbiterian Church</span></strong>. From hence to <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong> where we dined and lodged, is 12 Miles; and part of it very rough Road, but not equal
         to that thro’ horse Neck. The superb Landscape, however, which is to be seen from
         the meeting house of the latter is a rich regalia. We found all the Farmers busily
         employed in gathering, grinding, and expressing the Juice of their Apples; the Crop
         of which they say is rather above Mediocrity. The Average Crop of Wheat they add,
         is about 15 bushels to the Acre from their fallow land—often 20 &amp; from that to 25.
         The Destructive evidences of <strong><span class="Britain">British</span></strong> cruelty are yet visible both in <strong><span class="city">Norwalk</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong>; as there are the Chimneys of many burnt houses standing in them yet.<strong><span class="note">[43]</span></strong> The principal export from <strong><span class="city">Norwalk</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong> is Horses and Cattle—Salted Beef &amp; Porke, Lumber &amp; Indian Corn, to the West Indies—and
         in a small degree Wheat &amp; Flour.

      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 41. In 1788 Jacques (Jean) Pierre Brissot de Warville had traveled through the same
               area of western Greenwich on his way to New York. “The agreeable part of our journey
               ended at Fairfield,” Brissot noted. “For thirty-three miles from this town to Rye
               we had to fight our way over rocks and precipices. I did not know which to admire
               more, the driver’s daring or his skill. I cannot conceive how he succeeded twenty
               times in preventing the carriage from being shattered, or how his horses could check
               the coach when going down the veritable stairways of rocks. The word ‘stairways’ is
               no exaggeration. One of these, known as Horseneck, is nothing but a steep slope of
               boulders; if the [463] horses slipped, the coach would tumble 200 or 300 feet down
               into the valley below” (BRISSOT, 121).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 42. Webb’s tavern was at the corner of Main and Bank streets in Stamford, Conn. According
               to local tradition Mrs. Washington stayed at the tavern on her way to join GW at Cambridge
               in 1775 (CROFUT, 1:150).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note"> 43. In their attack on Norwalk 11 July 1779, the British burned over 100 houses and
               virtually destroyed the town. Brissot noted in 1788 that the “scars left by their
               infernal rage can still be seen. Most of the houses have been rebuilt, but those who
               knew the town before the war say that it was much finer then and that it was noted
               for its prosperous, even opulent, appearance” (BRISSOT, 121).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">Saturday 17th.</span></strong> A little after Sun-rise we left <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong>, &amp; passing through Et. <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong> breakfasted at <strong><span class="city">Stratford</span></strong>, wch. is ten Miles from <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong>, and is a pretty village on or near Stratford Rivr. The Road between these two places
         is not on the whole bad (for this Country)—in some places very gd. especially through
         Et. <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong> wch. is in a plain, and free from Stone. There are two decent looking Churches in
         this place—though small—viz.—an <strong><span class="religious">Episcopal</span></strong> and <strong><span class="religious">Presbeterian</span></strong>, or <strong><span class="religious">Congregationalist</span></strong> (as they call themselves). At <strong><span class="city">Stratford</span></strong> there is the same. At this place I was received with an effort of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Military</span></strong> parade; and was attended to the Ferry which is near a mile from the Center of the
         Town, by sevl. Gentlemen on horse back. <strong><span class="persName">Doctr. Johnson</span></strong> of the <strong><span class="political">Senate</span></strong> visited me here, being with <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Johnson </span></strong>in this Town (where he formerly resided).<strong><span class="note">[44]</span></strong> The Ferry is near half a Mile; and sometimes much incommoded by Winds and cross tides.
         The Navigation for Vessels of about 75 [464] Tonns extends up to Darby, ten Miles
         higher, where it is said there is a pretty brisk trade. At <strong><span class="city">Stratford</span></strong> they are establishing a Manufactury of Duck, and have lately turned out about 400
         bolts.<strong><span class="note">[45]</span></strong> From the Ferry it is abt. 3 Miles to <strong><span class="city">Milford</span></strong>, which is situated in more uneven and Stoney grd. than the 3 last Villages through
         wch. we passed. In this place there is but one Church, or in other words but one steeple—but
         there are Grist &amp; saw Mills and a handsome Cascade over the Tumbling dam; but one
         of the prettiest things of this kind is at Stamford occasioned also by damming the
         water for their Mills; it is near 100 yds. in width, and the water now being of a
         proper height, and the Rays of the Sun striking upon it as we passed, had a pretty
         effect upon the foaming Water as it fell. From <strong><span class="city">Millford</span></strong> we took the lower road through West haven, part of which was good and part rough,
         and arrived at <strong><span class="city">New haven</span></strong> before two Oclock; We had time to Walk through several parts of the City before Dinner.
         By taking the lower Road, we missed a Committee of the assembly, who had been appointed
         to wait upon, and escort me into town—to prepare an Address and to conduct me when
         I should leave the City as far as they should judge proper.<strong><span class="note">[46]</span></strong> The address was presented at 7 Oclock and at Nine I received another address from
         the Congregational Clergy of the place.<strong><span class="note">[47]</span></strong> Between the rect. of the two Addresses I received the Compliment of a Visit from
         the <strong><span class="persName">Govr. Mr. Huntington</span></strong> <strong><span class="note">[48]</span></strong>—the <strong><span class="persName">Lieutt. Govr.

         The number of Souls in it are said to be about 4000. There is an <strong><span class="religious">Episcopal Church</span></strong> and 3 Congregational Meeting Houses and a College in which there are at this time
         about 120 Students under auspices of <strong><span class="persName">Doctr. Styles</span></strong>.<strong><span class="note">[51]</span></strong> The Harbour of this place is not good for large Vessels—abt. 16 belongs to it. The
         Linnen Manufacture does not appear to be of so much importance as I had been led to
         believe—In a word I could hear but little of it.<strong><span class="note">[52]</span></strong> The Exports from this City are much the same as from <strong><span class="city">Fairfield</span></strong> &amp;ampca; and flax seed (chiefly to <strong><span class="state">New York</span></strong>). The Road from Kings bridge to this place runs as near the Sound as the Bays and
         Inlets will allow, but from hence to <strong><span class="city">Hartford</span></strong> it leaves the Sound and runs more to the Northward.

               ill health GW had written him a warm letter of appreciation (25 July 1781, DLC:GW).
               In 1786 he was elected governor of Connecticut, a post he held for 11 years. A firm

               Connecticut militia in the campaign against Burgoyne. He was elected to the Continental

         Town. In coming to it we passed thro East haven about mid way; after riding along
         the river of that name 6 Miles on which are extensive Marshes Now loaded with hay
         stacks—the ride is very pleasant, but the Road is Sandy which it continues to be within
         a Mile of the Tavern (Carringtons which is but an ordinary house)<strong><span class="note">[57]</span></strong> at <strong><span class="city">Wallingford</span></strong>.

         very fine. This, except the weaving, is the work of private families without interference

         round the Town, from the heights of which the prospect is beautiful. Belonging to

      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 58. Comfort Sage (1731–1799) was a native of Middletown Upper House in the area of
               present-day Cromwell, Conn. He had served in the Connecticut militia during the Revolution.
               Under the Confederation, Sage had held the post of naval officer for the port of Middletown,
               Conn., and in the summer of 1789 had written GW asking that he be retained in the
               revenue service (31 July, 8 Aug. 1789, DLC:GW). On 18 Aug. 1789 GW replied, expressing
               his regret that the post for Middletown had already been filled (DLC:GW). According
               to local tradition, Sage was confined to his bed at the time of GW’s visit (CROFUT,
               2:469). Since Sage’s pretensions were supported by such prominent citizens of Connecticut
               as Gov. Samuel Huntington (Huntington to GW, 19 Dec. 1789, DLC:GW), it is likely that
               GW’s call was intended to soften his refusal. In Feb. 1790 the incumbent of the Middletown
               post resigned and Sage received the appointment (EXECUTIVE JOURNAL, 1:38, 40).</span></strong></p>

               from the state of Connecticut in the form of tax exemptions and bounties. GW’s examination
               of the new textile manufactory increased his interest in the possibility of introducing
               such a system of manufacturing in his own state or at least offering inducements to
               Virginia farmers to increase the number of sheep. He wrote Gov. Beverley Randolph
               of Virginia: “By a little Legislative encouragement, the Farmers of Connecticut have,

               thro’ the Eastern States, I found that the Manufacturers of Woolens (for the Manufacture
               of Woolens is carried on there to very considerable extent and advantage) preferred
               the Wool raised in Virginia for its fineness, to that raised in more Northern parts
               of the Continent. If a greater quantity of Wool could be produced and if the hands
               (which are often in a manner idle) could be employ’d in the manufacturing it; a spirit
               of industry might be promoted, a great diminution might be made in the annual expences

The Distance from <strong><span class="city">Hartford</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Springfield </span></strong>is 28 Miles—both on Connecticut River. At the latter the River is crossed in Scows,
         set over with Poles and is about 80 rod wide. Between the two places is a fall and
         ten miles above <strong><span class="city">Springfield</span></strong> is another fall and others above that again—notwithstanding which much use is made
         of the Navigation for transportation in flats of about five tonns burthen. Seven miles

         where the Lands being good are much better cultivated. The whole Road from <strong><span class="city">Hartford</span></strong> to <strong><span class="city">Springfield</span></strong> is level &amp; good, except being too Sandy in places &amp; the Fields enclosed with Posts

         no poor—great similatude in their buildings—the general fashion of which is a Chimney
         (always of Stone or Brick) and door in the middle, with a stair case fronting the
         latter, running up by the side of the latter [former]—two flush Stories with a very
         good shew of Sash &amp; glass Windows. The size generally is from 30 to 50 feet in length
         and from 20 to 30 in width exclusive of a back shed which seems to be [471] added
         as the family encreases. The farms by the contiguity of the Houses are small not averaging
         more than 100 Acres. These are worked chiefly by Oxen (which have no other feed than
         Hay) with a horse &amp; sometimes two before them both in Plow &amp; Cart. In their light
         Lands and in their sleighs they work Horses, but find them much more expensive than
         Oxen. <strong><span class="city">Springfield</span></strong> is on the East side of Connecticut River; before you come to which a large branch

         that at the entrance I was welcomed by the Select men in a body, Then following the

         of which was this Inscription—<strong><span class="quote">“To the Man who unites all hearts”</span></strong> and on the other—<strong><span class="quote">“To Columbia’s favourite Son”</span></strong> and on one side thereof next the State House, in a pannel decorated with a trophy,

         20 feet high with the American Eagle perched on the top. After passing through the

         &amp; returning to a Balcony at the No. end—three [475] cheers was given by a vast concourse

               to GW and “the Gentlemen of your suit” to dine with him “en famille, at any hour that
               the circumstances of the day will admit” (DLC:GW). On the same day GW replied from
               Weston accepting the invitation (DNA: RG 59, Misc. Letters). The president had, however,
               assumed that the governor would make the first call. When it became apparent that
               Hancock’s illness, real or feigned, would not be an acceptable excuse to the president,
               he sent GW a note stating that “the Governor will do himself the honor of paying his
               respects in half an hour. This would have been done much sooner had his health in
               any degree permitted. He now hazards every thing as it respects his health for the

         is fishing—about 110 Vessels and 800 Men and boys are engaged in this business. Their
         chief export is fish. About 5000 Souls are said to be in this place which has the
         appearance of antiquity. The Houses are old—the streets dirty—and the common people
         not very clean. Before we entered the Town we were met, &amp; attended by a Comee. till
         we were handed over to the Select Men who conducted us saluted by artily. in to the
         Town—to the House of a <strong><span class="persName">Mrs. Lee</span></strong> where there was a cold Collation prepared <strong><span class="note">[99]</span></strong>—after partaking of which we visited the Harbour—their fish brakes for curing fish—&amp;ampca;
         and then proceeded (first receiving an Address from the Inhabitants) to <strong><span class="city">Salem</span></strong>. At the Bridge, 2 Miles from this Town, we were also met by a Committee—who conducted
         us by a <strong><span class="USmilitary">Brigade</span></strong> of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong>, &amp; one or two handsome <strong><span class="USmilitary">Corps</span></strong> in Uniform,<strong><span class="note">[100]</span></strong> through several of the Streets to the Town or Court House—where an Ode in honor of
         the President was sung—an address presented to him amidst the acclamations of the
         People—after which he was conducted to his Lodgings—recd. the compliments of many
         differt. Classes of People <strong><span class="note">[101]</span></strong>—and in the evening between 7 and 8 Oclock went to an assembly, where there was at
         least an hundred handsome and well dressed Ladies.<strong><span class="note">[102]</span></strong> Abt. Nine I returned to my Lodgings. The Road from <strong><span class="city">Boston</span></strong> to this place is here and there Stoney tho’ level; it is very pleasant: from most
         parts you are in sight of the Sea. Meads—arable Land and Rocky hills are much intermixed—the
         latter chiefly on the left. The Country seems to be in a manner entirely stripped
         of wood. The grazing is good—the Houses stand thick. After leaving <strong><span class="city">Cambridge</span></strong> at the distance of 4 Miles we passed through Mistick—then Malden—next Lynn (where
         it is said 175,000 pairs of Shoes (womens chiefly) have been made in a year by abt.
         400 workmen). This is only a row of houses &amp; not very thick on each side of the Road.
         After passing <strong><span class="city">Lynn</span></strong> you enter <strong><span class="city">Marblehead</span></strong> wch. is 4 Miles from Salem.<strong><span class="note">[103]</span></strong> This latter is a neat Town and said to contain 8 or 9000 Inhabitants. Its exports
         are chiefly Fish Lumber &amp; Provisions. [484] They have in the East India Trade at this
         time 13 Sale of Vessels.

      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 96. Joseph Willard (1738–1804), a member of a prominent New England family and an
               ardent Federalist, was president of Harvard from 1781 to 1804. Through his extensive
               writings and correspondence he became well known as a scientist and mathematician
               and led the college out of the financial and academic disorganization caused by the
               Revolution. GW was received at Harvard in the “Philosophy-room of the University”
               (Pa. Packet, 13 Nov. 1789).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 97. The orrery at Harvard was the work of Joseph Pope, Boston watchmaker, who had
               worked on it from 1776 to 1787. “It was an elaborate structure based on the design
               of the grand orreries produced by the great English makers of the period, measuring
               6½ feet in diameter and 6½ feet in height. It was covered with a glass dome with the
               signs of the zodiac painted on the glass side panels, and was supported on a hexagonal
               frame of mahogany in the Chippendale style. Twelve figures adorned its corners; these
               were said to have been carved in wood by Simeon Skillin and cast in bronze by Paul
               Revere.” The instrument had been purchased for Harvard through a lottery sponsored
               by the Massachusetts legislature in Mar. 1789 (BEDINI, 384–85).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 98. Jonathan Titcomb of Newburyport, Mass., had been in command of a Massachusetts
               regiment in 1775 and charged with securing supplies for the army during GW’s tour
               of duty at Cambridge. By the end of the war he was a major general in the state forces.
               In June 1789 he solicited the post of naval officer for Newburyport, and GW appointed
               him in August (Titcomb to GW, 19 June 1789, DLC:GW; EXECUTIVE JOURNAL, 1:9, 12). Two
               members of the Titcomb family of Newburyport—Michael and Zebulon—had been members
               of the Commander-in-Chief’s Guard during the Revolution (GODFREY, 259–60).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 99. Mrs. Lee was Martha Swett Lee (d. 1791), daughter of Joseph and Hannah Swett
               of Marblehead and wife of Col. Jeremiah Lee, a prominent Marblehead shipowner. The
               Lee house, on Washington Street, was an elegant mansion constructed in 1768, and Mrs.
               Lee was a noted hostess. According to local tradition, silhouettes of eagles were
               placed in the windows of the house during GW’s visit so they would show against the
               lighted candles (LORD, 234–36).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 100.These military units included the Salem town regiment, “joined by a Regiment
               from Lynn, with the Horse from Ipswich, the Independant Company, &amp; the Artillery.
               The Ipswich Horse were in blue with hats, the Independants in red, &amp; the Artillery
               in black uniforms. The Militia were partly in Rifle frocks” (Bentley, Diary, 1:130).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 101. To one observer GW’s progress to the courthouse seemed less than triumphant:
               “His appearance as he passed thro’ Court Street in Salem was far from gay, or making
               anyone else so. He looked oppressed by the attention that was paid him, and as he
               cast his eye around, I thought it seemed to sink at the notice he attracted. When
               he had got to the Court House, and had patiently listened to the ditty they sung at
               him, and heard the shouts of the multitude, he bowed very low, and as if he could
               bear no more turned hastily around and went into the house” (Hist. Collections of
               the Essex Institute, 67 [1931], 299–300).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p> <strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 102. While in Salem, GW lodged at the imposing Ward House on Court (now [485]Washington)
               Street, constructed between 1781 and 1785 by Samuel McIntire, and presently owned
               by Joshua Ward. For GW’s stay in Salem, see Bentley, Diary, 130–31; Gaz. of the U.S.,

      <p><strong><span class="date">Friday 30th.</span></strong> A Little after 8 Oclock I set out for <strong><span class="city">Newbury-Port</span></strong> and in less than 2 Miles crossed the Bridge between <strong><span class="city">Salem</span></strong> and <strong><span class="city">Beverly</span></strong>, which makes a handsome appearance, and is upon the same plan of those over Charles
         &amp; Mistick Rivers; excepting that it has not foot ways as that of the former has. The
         length of this bridge is 1530 feet and was built for about £4500 lawful money—a price
         inconceivably low in my estimation, as there is 18 feet water in the deepest parts
         of the River over which it is erected. This Bridge is longer than that at Charles
         town, but shorter by [      ] feet than the other over Mistick. All of them have draw
         bridges by which Vessels pass. After passing <strong><span class="city">Beverley</span></strong> 2 Miles we come to the Cotton Manufactury which seems to be carrying on with Spirit
         by the <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Cabbots</span></strong> (principally).<strong><span class="note">[104]</span></strong> In this Manufactury they have the New Invented Carding and Spinning Machines—one
         of the first supplies the work; and four of the latter; one of which spins 84 threads
         at a time by one person. The Cotton is [486] prepared for these Machines by being
         first (lightly) drawn to a thrd. on the common wheel. There is also another Machine
         for doubling and twisting the threads for particular cloths. This also does many at
         a time. For winding the Cotton from the spindles, &amp; preparing it for the Warp, there
         is a Reel which expedites the work greatly. A number of Looms (15 or 16) were at work
         with Spring shuttles which do more than dble. work. In short the whole seemed perfect,
         and the Cotton stuffs wch. they turn out excellent of their kind. Warp &amp; filling both
         are now of Cotton. From this place with escorts of Horse I passed on to <strong><span class="city">Ipswich</span></strong> about 10 Miles—at the entrance of which I was met and welcomed by the Select Men
         and received by a Regemt. of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong>. At this place I was met by <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Dalton</span></strong> and some other Gentlemen from <strong><span class="city">Newbury</span></strong>-port—partook of a Cold Collation, &amp; proceeded on to the last-mentioned place where
         I was received with much respect &amp; parade, about 4 Oclock. In the evening there were
         Rockets &amp; some other fire-works and every other demonstration to welcome me to the
         Town. This place is pleasantly situated on Merimack River, and appears to have carried
         on (here &amp; about) the Ship-building business to a grt. extent. The number of Souls
         is estimated at 5,000.<strong><span class="note">[105]</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="note" id="footnote"> 104. The Beverly Cotton Manufactory was established in 1787–88 with John Cabot and
               Joshua Fisher as managers and George and Andrew Cabot as leading stockholders. In
               its early years the factory received considerable encouragement from the Massachusetts
               legislature—a grant of land in 1789 and a state lottery in 1791. It was incorporated
               3 Feb. 1789 (BAGNALL, 93–94).</span></strong></p>

               local tradition, GW left his carriage just outside of town and, mounting his horse,
               proceeded to South (Bromfield) and High streets where, accompanied by considerable
               fanfare, an ode dedicated to the president was sung. The party then proceeded to Tracy
               House, originally owned by Nathaniel Tracy but now occupied by Joseph Prince, where
               GW was to lodge (CURRIER, 408–10).</span></strong></p>
      
      <p><strong><span class="date">Saturday 31st</span></strong>. Left <strong><span class="city">Newbury</span></strong>-port a little after 8 Oclock (first breakfasting with <strong><span class="persName">Mr. Dalton</span></strong>) <strong><span class="note">[106]</span></strong> and to avoid a wider ferry—more inconvenient boats—and a piece of heavy Sand, we
         crossed the River at <strong><span class="city">Salisbury</span></strong> two Miles above; and near that further about—and in three Miles came to the Line
         wch. divides the State of <strong><span class="state">Massachusetts</span></strong> from that of <strong><span class="state">New Hampshire</span></strong>.<strong><span class="note">[107]</span></strong> Here I took leave of<strong><span class="persName"> Mr. Dalton</span></strong> and many other private Gentlemen who accompanied me—also of <strong><span class="persName">Genl.

With this
         Cavalcade we proceeded and arrived before 3 Oclock at <strong><span class="city">Portsmouth</span></strong>, where we were received with every token of respect and appearance of Cordiallity
         under a discharge of Artillery. The Streets—doors and windows were Crouded here, as
         at all the other Places—and, alighting at the Town House, odes were Sung &amp; played
         in honor of the President. The same happened yesterday at my entrance into New-bury-port—Being
         stopped at my entrance to hear it. From the Town House I went to Colonel Brewsters
