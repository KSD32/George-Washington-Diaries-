      <p>Dr. Saml: I received your's of the <strong><span class="date">27th. of May,</span></strong> and assure you that nothing is more agreeable to me
         than to have our Deep run Tract divided; nor nothg. is more agreeable than for my
         Brothr. <strong><span class="persName">Jno</span></strong>. to act
         on my behalf, whose conduct in the affair I shall abide by: so that you have nothing
         more to do but
         consult with him about the time, and endeavour to get it done upon as cheap terms
         as possible.
         I am excessively hurried, therefore have not time to be particular in informing you
         of the occurencies
         that have, or may happen; we have got thus far, and shall continue on to <strong><span class="placeName">Fort Duquisne;</span></strong> where, I
         hope the dispute will soon be decided, and then I shall be able to give you a more
         particular acct.
         pray make my Compts. to my Sister and to <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Champes</span></strong> Family
         I am Dr. Saml. Yours.
