        <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
        
        <p>The purpose of this project is to take a look at George Washington, not just as a historical figure, but as a human being that had feelings and viewed the the world in his own way. Washington was a solider, general, commander, and eventually President, but he was also a son and a brother. For this project, any references that Washington made to other nations, military, people, locations, etc., have been markuped and highlighted for the reader to see. The reader then as the ability to read the text and determine for themselves the differences between his style of writing from the French and Indian War, American Revolution, and Constitutional Convention.</p>
