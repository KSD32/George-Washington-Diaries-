        <p>Welcome to the Washington Papers Project Site!</p>
            <p> George Washington was a prominent historical figure in American History. As a solider, general, politican and eventually, President, Washington played a major part in the politcal founding of what we known today as the United States of America.</p>
            <p>The Washington Papers project is an analyization of the writings of George Washington during two periods of his life. The project examines his role as a general during the American Revolutionary War and his presdency, both from a professional and personal view. This project looks at the differences in writing during these times, as well as differences between Washington as the President and Washington as a son, brother, and friend.</p>
