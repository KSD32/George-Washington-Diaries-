        <p>Welcome to the Washington Papers Project Site!</p>
            <p> George Washington was a prominent historical figure in American History. A solider, general, politican and, eventually, President, Washington played a major part in the politcal founding of what we known today as the United States of America.</p>
            <p>The Washington Papers project is an analyization of the writings of George Washington during two periods of his life: his role as a general during the American Revolutionary War, and his presdency. This project is looking at the difference in writing during these times, as well as difference between Washington the professional man, and the personal man.</p>
