      <p><strong><span class="date">Tuesday 30th.</span></strong> Having determined from the Report of the Commissioners, who were appointed to meet
         the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Insurgents</span></strong> in the Western Counties in the State of Pennsylvania, and from other circumstances—to repair to the places appointed for the Rendezvous,
         of the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong> of New Jersey Pennsylvania Maryland &amp; Virginia; I left the City of Philadelphia about half past ten oclock this forenoon accompanied by <strong><span class="persName">Colo. Hamilton</span></strong> (Secretary of the Treasury) &amp; my private Secretary. Dined at Norris Town and lodged at a place called the Trap—the first 17, and the latter 25 Miles from
         Philadelphia.
         At Norris Town we passed a detachment of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Militia</span></strong> who were preparing to march for the rendezvous at Carlisle—and at the Trap, late in the evening, we were overtaken by <strong><span class="persName">Major Stagg</span></strong> principal Clerk in the Department of War with letters from <strong><span class="persName">Genl. Wayne</span></strong> &amp; the Western Army containing official &amp; pleasing accounts of his engagement with
         the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Indians</span></strong> near the British Post [179] at the Rapids of the Miami of the Lake and of his having
         destroyed all the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Indian</span></strong> Settlements on that River in the vicinity of the said Post quite up to the grand
         Glaize—the quantity not less than 5000 acres—and the Stores &amp;. of <strong><span class="persName">Colo. McGee</span></strong> the <strong><span class="USmilitary">British</span></strong> Agent of <strong><span class="USmilitary">Indian</span></strong> Affairs a mile or two from the <strong><span class="USmilitary">Garrison</span></strong>.
