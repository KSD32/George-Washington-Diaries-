         <p> Honour'd Madam: I cam to this place last <date>Saturday</date>, and shall set out to morrow with the General of <location><settlement>Wills Creek</settlement></location>; where I fear we shall wait some time for a sufficient
            number of Waggons to transport us over the Mountains.
            I am very happy in the General's Family, and I am treated with a complaisant Freedom which is quite agreeable; so that I have no occasion to doubt the satisfaction I
            propos'd in making the Campaigne. As we have met with nothing yet worth relating I shall only beg my love to my Brother's and Sister's; and Compliments to Friends.
            I am , Honour'd Madam
            Your most dutiful and obedient son,
         </p>
