         <placeName>Head Quarters, New York,</placeName> <dateline>June 13, 1776.</dateline>
           <p> Sir: I am to inform you that <persName>Colonel Nicholson,</persName> of whose Character and Conduct you have received
            an unfavorable Impression, is in Town; he comes for the purpose of raising Recruits for a <orgName>New York</orgName>
            Battalion, to the Command of which he has been nominated. When I intimated to him, that from
            certain representations I had received, I judged him very unfit for the Employment, he insisted upon
            a Court of Enquiry to manifest his Innocence, and clear his reputation. Now Sir, as I am not well
            apprized of any particular charge to be exhibited against him, I must request you to acquaint me
            with what you know of the matter, and what persons it will be proper to call in as Witnesses; he may
            otherwise be acquited by the Court (when there are just Grounds of Accusation) merely for want of
            Testimony. I am, etc.</p>
