         <orgName>Bullskin,</orgName><dateline>April 30, 1755.</dateline>
            <p>Dear Madam: In order to engage your corrispondence, I think it expedient just to deserve it; which' I
            shall endeavour to do by embracing the earliest, and every oppertunity of writing to you.
            It will be needless to expatiate on the pleasures that communication of this kind will afford me, as it
            shall suffice to say; a corrispondance with my Friends is the greatest satisfaction I expect to enjoy, in
            the course of the Campaigne, and that none of my friends are able to convey more real delight than
            you can to whom I stand indebted for so many obligations.</p>
            <p>If an old proverb can claim my belief I am certainly [ ? ] share of success; for surely no man ever
            made a worse beginning, than I have; out of 4 Horses which we brought from home, one was kill'd
            outright, and the other 3 render'd unfit for use; so that I have been detain'd here three days already,
            and how much longer I may continue to be so, the Womb of time most discover.
            I must beg my Compliments to <persName>Miss. Hannah,</persName> <persName>Miss Dent,</persName> and any other's that think me worthy of
            their enquirys.</p>
            <p>I am Madam Yr. most Obedt. Servt.</p>
