           <p> Sir: [The Army und'r the Com'd of <persName>G: Braddock</persName> has met with an unfortunate defeat, which has
            occasioned my ret'n]54 from the Ohio; [This circumstance enables me to order] the Militia of the
            several Countys in my district, to meet me and I have therefore taken this earliest oppertunity of
            inform'g you of it; that you may not be troubled ab't any but <placeName>Eastern Shore Countys,</placeName> unless you will
            undertake to exercise the whole (saving the two Frontier Countys viz Fairfax and Prince Win. which I
            will take the trouble off) for the Consideration of 40,£'s if you accept of this offer, I shou'd be glad to
            know it before the first of Sept. and I have enclos'd you a Mem'm. of the appointed times that I have
            desit'd the Officer's, and Militia of each County to meet, that you may proceed accordingly. I am Sir,
            etc.
