         <orgName>Camp, at George's-Creek,</orgName> <dateline>June 14, 1755.</dateline>
           <p> Dr. Saml: I received your's of the <date>27th. of May,</date> and assure you that nothing is more agreeable to me
            than to have our Deep run Tract divided; nor nothg. is more agreeable than for my Brothr. Jno. to act
            on my behalf, whose conduct in the affair I shall abide by: so that you have nothing more to do but
            consult with him about the time, and endeavour to get it done upon as cheap terms as possible.
            I am excessively hurried, therefore have not time to be particular in informing you of the occurencies
            that have, or may happen; we have got thus far, and shall continue on to <placeName>Fort Duquisne;</placeName> where, I
            hope the dispute will soon be decided, and then I shall be able to give you a more particular acct.
            pray make my Compts. to my Sister and to <persName>Colo. Champes</persName> Family
            I am Dr. Saml. Yours.</p>
