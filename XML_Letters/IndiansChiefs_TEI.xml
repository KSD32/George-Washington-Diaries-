         <p><orgName type="#NativeTribe">Brothers of Passamaquodia</orgName>	<location><settlement>Bucks County,</settlement></location> <location><region>Pa</region></location>., <date>24 December 1776</date></p>
         <p>I am glad to hear by <persName>Major Shaw</persName>, that You Accepted of the Chain of Freindship which I sent you last <date>February</date> from <location><settlement>Cambridge</settlement></location>, &amp; that you are determined to keep it bright and unbroken.1</p>
         <p> When I first heard that you refused to send any of your Warriours to my Assistance when called upon by our Brothers of <persName>St Johns</persName> I did not know what to think; I was Afraid that some <orgName type="#Britain">Enemy</orgName> had turned your Hearts Against Me. But I am since informed that all your young Men were employed in Hunting, which was the reason of their not coming; This has Made my Mind easy, and I hope you will allways in future join with your Brothers of <persName>St Johns &amp; Penobscott</persName> when required.</p>
         <p>I have desired My Brother the <roleName type="#USpolitical">Governr</roleName> of <location><settlement>Massachusetts Bay</settlement></location> to pay you the Money which <persName>Capt. Smith</persName> promised you for Sending My Letters to the <orgName type="#NativeTribe">Micmack Indians</orgName>.2</p>
        <p> Brothersâ€”I have a peice of News to tell you which I hope you will Attend to.
           Our <orgName type="#Britain">Enemy</orgName> the <roleName type="#ForeignPolitical">King of <orgName type="#Britain">Great Britain</orgName></roleName> endeavoured to Stir up all the <orgName type="#NativeTribe">Indians</orgName> from <orgName type="#nation">Canada </orgName>to <location><settlement>South Carolina</settlement></location> Against Us, But our Bretheren of the <orgName type="#IroquoisNation">Six Nations</orgName> and their Allies the <orgName type="#NativeTribe">Shawanese</orgName> and <orgName type="#NativeTribe">Delewares</orgName> would not hearken to the Advice of the Messengers sent among them but kept fast hold of our Ancient Covenant Chain; The <orgName type="#NativeTribe">Cherokees</orgName> and the <orgName type="#NativeTribe">Southern Tribes</orgName> were foolish enough to listen to them, and to take up the Hatchet Against us, Upon this our Warriours went into their [434] Country, burnt their Houses, destroyed their Corn, and Oblidged them to sue for peace and give Hostages for their future Good Behaviour.</p>
         <p> Now Brothers never lett the <persName>Kings</persName> Wicked Councellors turn your Hearts Against Me and your Bretheren of this Country, but bear in Mind what I told you last February and what I tell you now. In token of my Freindship I send you this from my <orgName type="#USmilitary">Army</orgName> on the Banks of the great <placeName>River Delaware</placeName> this <date>24th Day of December 1776</date>.</p>
         <p><persName>George Washington</persName></p>
