         <placeName>Camp at Will's Creek,</placeName> <dateline>June 7, 1755.</dateline>
            <p>Dear Jack: As much hurried as I am at present, I can't think of leaving this place without writing to
            you; tho' I have no time to be particular. I was Escorted by 8 Men of the Militia from <placeName>Winchester</placeName> to
            this place; which 8 Men were 2 Days assembling; but I believe they wou'd not have been more than
            as many seconds dispersing if I had been attacked. Upon arrival here, I found <persName>Sir Jno. St. Clair</persName>
            with a body of 500 Men were March'd to prepare the Roads, lay a deposit of Provisions at the little
            Meadows, and to erect some kind of defensive work there.</p>
            <p>To morrow <persName>Sir Peter</persName> with the first Brigade, begin their March, and on Monday the General and the 2d. will follow. We have no certain acct. from 
            the <orgName>Ohio:</orgName> but have advices from <placeName>Philadelphia</placeName> that a body of 300 F. pass'd Oswego on their way to <placeName>Fort Duquisne,</placeName> and
            that a larger Detachment was hourly expected. A Captn. of <persName>Sir Peter's </persName>Regim't with several of the
            common Soldiers of the different Corps has died since our Incampm't here, and many others are
            now sick with a kind of bloody Flux. I wrote from <placeName>Winchester</placeName> a Letter which I hope you have receiv'd
            and shou'd be glad of an answer as soon as possible; any Letter's to me, directed to the care of <persName>Mr.
            Cox,</persName> at <placeName>Winchester,</placeName> will be certain of a conveyance I am <perName>Dr. Jack</perName> Yr. most Affe. Brother
